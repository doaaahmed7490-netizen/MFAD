As a result, investors may be willing to pay a higher price for the potential growth opportunities offered by small-cap stocks, which can lead to higher P\/E ratios.On the other hand, large-cap stocks tend to be more established and stable, with a longer track record of earnings and revenue growth. As a result, these stocks may trade at lower P\/E ratios, as investors may be less willing to pay a premium for their growth potential.It is important to note that P\/E ratios are just one factor to consider when evaluating a stock and should not be used in isolation. Other factors, such as the company's financial health, industry trends, and macroeconomic conditions, can also impact a stock's P\/E ratio."]},

A share split is when a company increases the number of outstanding shares by issuing more shares to existing shareholders. For example, if a company does a 2-for-1 share split, it means that each shareholder will receive an additional share for each share they own. This is done to make the shares more affordable and to increase the liquidity of the stock.On the other hand, share redemption is when a company buys back some of its outstanding shares from shareholders. This is done to reduce the number of outstanding shares and can be done for various reasons, such as to increase the value of the remaining shares or to free up capital.Dividend, on the other hand, is a distribution of a company's profits to its shareholders. It is paid in the form of cash, shares of stock, or other assets.

{"question":"Pros and Cons of Interest Only Loans","human_answers":["The main disadvantage is that interest rates are higher for the interest-only loan. It's higher risk to the bank, since the principal outstanding is higher for longer.  According to the New York Times, \"Interest rates are usually an eighth- to a half-percentage point higher than on fully amortized jumbo loans.\" They're also tougher to qualify for, and fewer lenders offer them, again due to the risk to the bank. Since you can always put extra towards the principal, strictly speaking, these are the only  downsides. The upside, of course, is that you can make a lower payment each month. The question is what are you doing with this? If this is the only way you can afford the payments, there's a good chance the house is too expensive for you. You're not building equity in the home, and you have the risk of being underwater if the house price goes down. If you're using the money for other things, or you have variable income, it might be a different story. For the former, reinvesting in a business you own might be a reason, if you're cognizant of the risks. For the latter, salespeople on commission, or financial industry types who get most of their income in bonuses, can benefit from the flexibility."],"chatgpt_answers":["An interest-only loan is a type of loan in which the borrower pays only the interest on the loan for a certain period of time, rather than paying down any of the principal balance. After the interest-only period ends, the borrower must start paying down the principal in addition to the interest.Here are some pros and cons of interest-only loans:Pros:Lower monthly payments: Because the borrower is only paying the interest on the loan during the interest-only period, the monthly payments are typically lower than they would be with a traditional loan. This can make it easier for the borrower to afford the loan.Flexibility: Interest-only loans can provide flexibility to borrowers who expect their income to increase in the future. For example, if a borrower expects to receive a raise or promotion in the near future, they may choose an interest-only loan so that they can afford the lower payments in the short term.Investment opportunities: Some borrowers choose interest-only loans so that they can use their extra cash to invest in other opportunities, such as real estate or stocks.Cons:Higher overall costs: Because the borrower is not paying down any of the principal balance during the interest-only period, the overall cost of the loan will be higher than it would be with a traditional loan.Risk of payment shock: When the interest-only period ends, the borrower must start paying down the principal in addition to the interest. This can lead to a significant increase in the monthly payments, which is known as \"payment shock.\" This can be a burden for borrowers who are not prepared for the higher payments.Limited availability: Interest-only loans are not as widely available as traditional loans, and they may be more difficult to qualify for.Overall, it's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of an interest-only loan before deciding whether it's the right choice for you.

Here are some general guidelines to consider:Conventional wisdom suggests that you should aim for a down payment of at least 20% of the purchase price of the home. This is because mortgage lenders typically require a down payment of at least 20% in order to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is an insurance policy that protects the lender in case you default on your loan. PMI can add significantly to your monthly mortgage payments, so avoiding it can save you a significant amount of money over the life of your loan.However, it is possible to obtain a mortgage with a down payment of less than 20%. Many lenders offer programs that allow you to put down as little as 3% or even 0% in some cases. These loans typically come with higher interest rates and may require you to pay PMI, so they may not be the best option if you have the means to make a larger down payment.In addition to the size of your down payment, you should also consider other factors such as your overall financial situation, your ability to save for a down payment, and your long-term financial goals. It may be worth saving up for a larger down payment if it means you can get a lower interest rate on your mortgage, or if it means you will have more equity in your home.

It also applies to the value of any benefits received under the plan, such as coverage for medical expenses or prescription drugs.On the other hand, individual health insurance, which is purchased by individuals directly from insurers or through the health insurance marketplace, is generally not tax-free. This means that individuals who purchase their own health insurance must pay taxes on the premiums they pay for the coverage. However, there are some tax credits and subsidies available to help lower-income individuals afford the cost of individual health insurance.It's important to note that the tax treatment of health insurance may vary depending on the specific circumstances and the specific type of health insurance coverage. It's always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or refer to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for more information on the tax treatment of health insurance."]},

{"question":"Bid price\u2026 sudden Drop","human_answers":["An option gives you the option rather than the obligation to buy (or sell) the underlying so you don't have to exercise you can just let the option expire (so long it doesn't have an automatic expiry). After expiration the option is worthless if it is out of the money but other than that has no hangover. Option prices normally drop as the time value of the option decays. An option has two values associated with it; time value and exercise value. Far out of the money (when the price of the underlying is far from the strike price on the losing side) options only have time value whereas deep in the money options (as yours seems to be) has some time value as well as the intrinsic value of the right to buy (sell) at a low (high) price and then sell (buy) the underlying.  The time value of the option comes from the possibility that the price of the underlying will move (further) in your favour and make you more money at expiry. As expiry closes it is less likely that there will be a favourable mood so this value declines which can cause prices to move sharply after a period of little to no revaluing. Up to now what I have said applies to both OTC and traded options but exchange traded options have another level of complexity in their trading; because there are fewer traders in the options market the size of trade at which you can move the market is much lower. On the equities markets you may need to trade millions of shares to have be substantial enough to significantly move a price, on the options markets it could be thousands or even hundreds. If these are European style options (which sounds likely) and a single trading entity was holding a large number of the exchange traded options and now thinks that the price will move significantly against them before expiry their sell trade will move the market lower in spite of the options being in the money. Their trade is based on their supposition that by the time they can exercise the option the price will be below the strike and they will lose money. They have cashed out at a price that suited them and limited what they will lose if they are right about the underlying.

{"question":"Leasing a car I intend to buy","human_answers":["I have a colleague who always leases cars first.  He's very well off, has piles of money in savings, owns a home, and the cherry on top, he could just write a check for the car....   He sees the lease as an insurance policy on the first couple of years of the car's life.  If it gets in an accident or he finds something about it he doesn't like, he can give it back to the dealer at the end of the term with no hassle and move on to the next car.  Some people value the fact that a lease is a rental.   If you're leasing a luxury car or something you couldn't otherwise afford, no amount of mental gymnastics will turn this in to a good idea.   Separately, you should never make a down payment on a lease.  If the car is totaled early on, you will not recoupe the money you put down.  The issue here is that while the numbers all work out the same between a lease and a purchase your situation is different.  If the leased car is totaled, the bank gets its money back from an insurer.  If that payment doesn't cover the value of the car, the GAP insurance will cover it.  In either situation, if there's an excess remaining it will be returned to you.  The issue is the excess may not fully replace your down payment.  If you then went to lease another car you would need to come up with that down payment again because you couldn't just simply choose to lease a used car; like you could in the case of a purchase.  Additionally, GAP is generally included in a lease whether you want it or not.

At the end of the lease, you have the option to purchase the car for a predetermined price, return the car to the leasing company, or lease a new car.Here are some things to consider when leasing a car that you intend to buy:Down payment: Most leasing companies will require a down payment, which is a percentage of the car's value that you pay upfront. The down payment can be used to lower your monthly payments, but it will not be applied to the purchase price of the car if you decide to buy it at the end of the lease.Mileage limits: Leasing contracts often have mileage limits, which means you are only allowed to drive the car a certain number of miles per year. If you exceed the mileage limit, you may be charged a fee for each additional mile. This can be an issue if you plan to drive the car a lot or if you are unsure how much you will be driving.Maintenance: When you lease a car, you are responsible for maintaining it in good condition. This includes regular oil changes, tire rotations, and other routine maintenance. If the car is not well-maintained, you may be charged a fee when you return it at the end of the lease.Purchase price: If you decide to purchase the car at the end of the lease, you will need to pay the predetermined purchase price. This price is often higher than the fair market value of the car, so it's important to consider whether it's worth it to buy the car or if you would be better off leasing a new car or purchasing a used car instead.Overall, leasing a car can be a good option if you want to drive a new car without committing to a long-term loan, but it's important to carefully consider the terms of the lease and whether it's the best option for you."]},

Here is a brief overview of some key concepts that you may encounter when buying a home:Down payment: A down payment is the amount of money that you put towards the purchase of a home. It is typically expressed as a percentage of the home's purchase price. For example, if you are buying a home for $200,000 and you put down 20%, your down payment would be $40,000. Down payments are typically required for most types of mortgage loans, and the size of your down payment can affect the terms of your mortgage.Private mortgage insurance (PMI): PMI is a type of insurance that is often required for home buyers who make a down payment of less than 20% of the home's purchase price. PMI protects the lender in the event that you default on your mortgage payments. The cost of PMI is typically added to your monthly mortgage payments, and it can be removed once you have built up enough equity in your home.Points: Points are a type of fee that you may be required to pay at closing when you take out a mortgage. One point is equal to 1% of the mortgage loan amount. Points are typically used to buy down the interest rate on a mortgage, which can lower your monthly payments. However, the decision to pay points is a trade-off, as you may pay more up front in exchange for lower monthly payments over the life of the loan.It's important to carefully consider all of these factors when buying a home, and to consult with a financial professional to determine the best options for your specific situation.","As a first-time home buyer, you may have a lot of questions about the process of purchasing a home, including how much money you will need to put down as a down payment and what types of mortgage insurance or points you may need to pay.

It is usually expressed as a percentage of the total purchase price. Most lenders require a down payment of at least 3% of the purchase price, although some may require a higher percentage. In some cases, you may be able to qualify for a mortgage with a down payment of as little as 3.5% if you meet certain criteria, such as being a first-time homebuyer or being a veteran.Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI):Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is a type of insurance that protects the lender in case you default on your mortgage. It is required if you put down less than 20% of the purchase price as a down payment. PMI is typically paid as a monthly premium, and the cost is based on the size of your mortgage and the amount of your down payment.Points:Points are fees that you pay to the lender at closing in exchange for a lower interest rate on your mortgage. One point is equal to 1% of the loan amount. For example, if you are taking out a $200,000 mortgage and you pay two points, you will pay $4,000 in points at closing. Points can be a good option if you plan to stay in your home for a long time and you want to save on interest payments over the life of the loan. However, they may not make sense if you plan to sell the home or refinance within a few years, as you may not recoup the cost of the points.It's important to consider all of these factors when deciding how much to put down as a down payment and whether to pay points or PMI.

{"question":"How are ADRs priced?","human_answers":["Academic research into ADRs seems to suggest that pairs-trading ADRs and their underlying shares reveals that there certainly are arbitrage opportunities, but that in most (but not all cases) such opportunities are quickly taken care of by the market.

In some cases parity doesn't seem to be reached, which may have to do with transaction costs, the risk of transacting in a foreign market, as well as administrative & legal concerns that can affect the direct holder of a foreign share but don't impact the ADR holder (since those risks and costs are borne by the institution, which presumably has a better idea of how to manage such risks and costs). It's also worth pointing out that there are almost always arbitrage opportunities that get snapped up quickly: the law of one price doesn't apply for very short time-frames, just that if you're not an expert in that particular domain of the market, it might as well be a law since you won't see the arbitrage opportunities fast enough. That is to say, there are always opportunities for arbitrage with ADRs but chances are YOU won't be able to take advantage of it (In the Mexican case, the price divergence seems to have an average half-life of ~3 days). Some price divergence might be expected: ADR holders shouldn't be expected to know as much about the foreign market as the typical foreign share holder, and that uncertainty may also cause some divergence.

If the value of the foreign currency declines relative to the U.S. dollar, the value of the ADR may also decline, even if the value of the underlying shares remains unchanged.In general, the price of an ADR will be closely tied to the price of the underlying shares, although there may be some differences due to factors such as the fees associated with holding and trading the ADRs, and any differences in the trading hours or liquidity of the two markets."]},
{"question":"My medical bill went to a collection agency. Can I pay it directly to the hospital?","human_answers":["Short Answer Collections agencies and the businesses they collect for are two different animals. If you don't want this to hurt your credit I suggest you deal directly with the hospital. Pay the bill, but prior to paying it get something in writing that specifically says that this will not be reported onto your credit. That is of course if the hospital even lets you pay them directly. Usually once something is sold to a collections company it's written off.  Long Answer Credit reports are kind of a nightmare to deal with. The hospital just wants their money so they will sell debt off to collections companies. The collections companies want to make money on the debt they've bought so they will do what ever it takes to get it out of you, including dinging your credit report. The credit bureaus are the biggest nightmare to deal with of all. Once something is reported on your credit history they do little to nothing to remove it. You can report it online but this is a huge mistake because when you report online you wave your rights to sue the credit bureaus if they don't investigate the matter properly. This of course leads to massive amounts of claims being under investigated.  So what are your options once something hits your credit history? I know this all sounds bleak but the reason I go into such depth is that they likely have already reported it to the credit bureaus and you just don't see it reported yet. Good luck to you.

You may need to contact the hospital or medical provider to ask about their policies for paying bills that have been sent to collections. It is also a good idea to confirm the amount that you owe and to find out if there are any discounts or financial assistance programs available.If you are able to pay the bill directly to the hospital, it is important to obtain a receipt or written confirmation of the payment. This can help to ensure that the payment is applied to your account correctly and that the bill is removed from collections.It is also a good idea to communicate with the collection agency to let them know that you have paid the bill and to ask them to update their records accordingly. This can help to avoid any confusion or additional collection efforts in the future.Keep in mind that paying a medical bill directly to the hospital may not always be an option. In some cases, the hospital may require that you pay the collection agency directly. In this situation, it is important to follow the instructions provided by the hospital and the collection agency."]},
{"question":"Should I carry less renter's insurance if I can self-insure?","human_answers":["I believe your statement is mostly correct:  ...all the expert recommendations are based on an inflexible conventional wisdom that presumes that all renters are relatively resource-poor. When you purchase a $50 electronic item at the store and are offered an extended warranty for $3, most people turn it down, not only because they don't think it's worth it, but also because in the event that the item fails between say years 1 and 3, they don't worry enough about that $50 to care if they have to buy a new one, or live without it. The percentage of your net worth also matters. For example, if you had an entire loss tomorrow, you'd be out $20K if you needed to re-purchase your possessions. (30K minus 10K in current coverage.) $20K is approximately 1\/44 or 2.3% of your net worth. If a catastrophe occurs and you only lose 2.3% of your net worth, some might consider that lucky, so from that point of view it isn't really a big deal. But on the flip side, if the extra insurance only costs you $50 more per year, you may not even notice that dent in your net worth either. I think for most people, the value of items in their home may be their net worth, or at least a much larger percentage of it, in which case the insurance makes more sense. For someone in your position, it probably doesn't make much difference either way. If you had $300K in valuables in your house, perhaps your point of view would be different."],"chatgpt_answers":["Self-insuring means that you are taking on the risk of financial loss yourself, rather than transferring that risk to an insurance company through a policy. It can be a good idea to self-insure for smaller losses that you can easily afford to pay out of pocket, but it is generally not a good idea to self-insure for large losses or disasters, such as a fire or a natural disaster, as the financial impact of these events can be significant and difficult to recover from.Renter's insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for your personal property and liability in the event of a loss, such as theft, fire, or water damage. It can also provide coverage for additional living expenses if you are unable to live in your rental due to a covered loss. Renter's insurance is typically relatively inexpensive and can provide valuable protection for your personal property and financial well-being.In general, it is a good idea to have some level of renter's insurance to protect against potential losses, even if you are able to self-insure for smaller losses. It is important to carefully consider your individual circumstances and the level of coverage that is appropriate for your needs.

{"question":"Interest on Amount Exceeding CC Balance?","human_answers":["The best answer to this is: Read the fine print on your credit card agreement. What is common, at least in the US, is that you can make any charges you want during a time window.  When the date comes around that your statement balance is calculated, you will owe interest on any amount that is showing up as outstanding in your account.  Example...  To revise the example you gave, let's say Jan 1. your account balance was $0. Jan. 3rd you went out and spent $1,000.  Your account statement will be prepared every XX days... usually 30. So if your last statement was Dec. 27th, you can expect your next statement to be prepared ~Jan.24 or Jan. 27.  To be safe, (i.e. not accrue any interest charges) you will want to make sure that your balance shows $0 when your statement is next prepared.  So back to the example you gave--if your balance showed $1,000... and you paid it off, but then charged $2,000 to it... so that there was now a new set of $2,000 charges in your account, then the bank would begin charging you interest when your next statement was prepared.  Note that there are some cards that give you a certain number of days to pay off charges before accruing interest... it just goes back to my saying \"the best answer is read the fine print on your card agreement.\""],"chatgpt_answers":["If you have a credit card with a balance that exceeds your credit limit, you may be charged an over-limit fee by your credit card issuer. In addition to the over-limit fee, you may also be charged interest on any amount that you charge to your credit card that exceeds your credit limit. The interest rate on this type of balance is typically higher than the interest rate on your regular credit card balance.It's important to keep your credit card balance within your credit limit to avoid over-limit fees and high interest charges. If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card or if you are consistently carrying a balance that exceeds your credit limit, you may want to consider contacting your credit card issuer to discuss your options.

{"question":"How should residents of smaller economies allocate their portfolio between domestic and foreign assets?","human_answers":["We face the same issue here in Switzerland. My background: Institutional investment management, currency risk management. My thoughs are: Home Bias is the core concept of your quesiton. You will find many research papers on this topic. The main problems with a high home bias is that the investment universe in your small local investment market is usually geared toward your coutries large corporations. Lack of diversification: In your case: the ASX top 4 are all financials, actually banks, making up almost 25% of the index. I would expect the bond market to be similarly concentrated but I dont know. In a portfolio context, this is certainly a negative. Liquidity: A smaller economy obviously has less large corporations when compared globally (check wikipedia \/ List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization) thereby offering lower liquidity and a smaller investment universe. Currency Risk: I like your point on not taking a stance on FX. This simplifies the task to find a hedge ratio that minimises portfolio volatility when investing internationally and dealing with currencies. For equities, you would usually find that a hedge ratio anywhere from 0-30% is effective and for bonds one that ranges from 80-100%. The reason is that in an equity portfolio, currency risk contributes less to overall volatility than in a bond portfolio. Therefore you will need to hedge less to achieve the lowest possible risk. Interestingly, from a global perspective, we find, that the AUD is a special case whereby, if you hedge the AUD you actually increase total portfolio risk. Maybe it has to do with the AUD being used in carry trades a lot, but that is a wild guess. Hedged share classes: You could buy the currency hedged shared classes of investment funds to invest globally without taking currency risks. Be careful to read exactly what and how the share class implements its currency hedging though."],"chatgpt_answers":["The best way for residents of smaller economies to allocate their portfolio between domestic and foreign assets will depend on their individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Some factors to consider when making this decision include the potential returns, risks, and diversification benefits of each asset class, as well as the investor's ability to handle currency exchange risk and the overall economic environment in their home country.One approach to portfolio allocation for residents of smaller economies is to diversify across both domestic and foreign assets to help spread risk and potentially increase returns. This could involve investing in a mix of domestic stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents, as well as foreign stocks, bonds, and other investment instruments.It's important to remember that investing in foreign assets carries additional risks, such as currency exchange risk and political risk, that may not be present in domestic investments. Investors should carefully assess these risks and consider the impact they may have on their portfolio.It's also a good idea to consult with a financial professional or advisor to help assess the risks and potential returns of different investment options and to develop a portfolio allocation strategy that is tailored to the individual's financial situation and goals."]},
{"question":"Would I ever need credit card if my debit card is issued by MasterCard\/Visa?","human_answers":["My view is from the Netherlands, a EU country. Con: Credit cards are more risky. If someone finds your card, they can use it for online purchases without knowing any PIN, just by entering the card number, expiration date, and security code on the back. Worse, sometimes that information is stored in databases, and those get stolen by hackers! Also, you can have agreed to do periodic payments on some website and forgot about them, stopped using the service, and be surprised about the charge later. Debit cards usually need some kind of device that requires your PIN to do online payments (the ones I have in the Netherlands do, anyway), and automated periodic payments are authorized at your bank where you can get an overview of the currently active ones. Con: Banks get a percentage of each credit card payment. Unlike debit cards where companies usually pay a tiny fixed fee for each transaction (of, say, half a cent), credit card payments usually cost them a percentage and it comes to much more, a significant part of the profit margin. I feel this is just wrong. Con: automatic monthly payment can come at an unexpected moment With debit cards, the amount is withdrawn immediately and if the money isn't there, you get an error message allowing you to pay some other way (credit card after all, other bank account, cash, etc). When a recent monthly payment from my credit card was due to be charged from my bank account recently, someone else had been paid from it earlier that day and the money wasn't there. So I had to pay interest, on something I bought weeks ago... Pro: Credit cards apparently have some kind of insurance. I've never used this and don't know how it works, but apparently you can get your money back easily after fraudulent charges. Pro: Credit cards can be more easily used internationally for online purchases I don't know how it is with Visa or MC-issued debit cards, but many US sites accept only cards that have number\/expiration date\/security code and thus my normal bank account debit card isn't useable. Conclusion: definitely have one, but only use it when absolutely necessary."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is generally not necessary to have a credit card if you have a debit card, as a debit card allows you to access the funds in your checking or savings account to make purchases or withdraw cash. However, there are some situations where a credit card may be more convenient or necessary:Emergencies: If you don't have enough money in your checking or savings account to cover an emergency expense, a credit card can be a useful backup.Travel: Some hotels and rental car companies may require a credit card to hold as a deposit, even if you are paying with a debit card.Rewards: Some credit cards offer rewards or other benefits (such as cash back or points) for using the card, which may be more valuable than any rewards offered by your debit card.Online shopping: Some online merchants may require a credit card as a form of payment, even if they also accept debit cards.Building credit: Using a credit card responsibly and paying off the balance in full each month can help you build a positive credit history, which can be beneficial when you apply for loans or other financial products in the future.Overall, whether or not you need a credit card in addition to your debit card will depend on your individual financial situation and needs.

Semi related question (answers have some good info) -  Construction loan for new house replacing existing mortgaged house?"],"chatgpt_answers":["If you are considering tearing down an existing house and building a new one, there are several mortgage loan implications to consider.First, you will need to obtain financing for the construction of the new house. This can typically be done through a construction loan, which is a short-term loan that provides funds to cover the cost of building the new house. Construction loans typically require a down payment of at least 20% of the total cost of the project, and the loan is typically paid off once the construction is complete and the house is sold or refinanced.It's important to note that construction loans can be more expensive and have higher interest rates than traditional mortgages, as they involve a higher level of risk for the lender. You may also be required to have a higher credit score and a higher debt-to-income ratio to qualify for a construction loan.In addition to obtaining financing for the construction of the new house, you will also need to consider the financing for the land on which the new house will be built. If you already own the land, you may be able to use the equity in the land as collateral for the construction loan. If you need to purchase the land, you will need to obtain a separate mortgage loan to finance the purchase.Finally, it's important to consider the tax implications of tearing down an existing house and building a new one. Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to claim certain tax deductions or credits for the construction of the new house, such as the cost of materials, labor, and design fees. You should consult with a tax professional to determine what tax implications apply in your situation."]},

Researching a stock's value means trying to figure out if there is something relevant to these cash flows that the market doesn't know about or has misjudged.  Pretty much anything we can list for you here that will affect a stock's price is something the market knows about, so it's not likely to help you know if something is mispriced.

{"question":"Should I always pay my credit at the last day possible to maximize my savings interest?","human_answers":["Mostly ditto to Dillip Sarwate. Let me just add: I don't know how you're making your payments, whether through the biller's web site, your bank's web site, by mail, in person, etc. But whatever the mechanism, if there is a chance that waiting until the due date to pay may mean that you will miss the due date: don't. The cost of a late payment charge is likely to far exceed any interest you would collect on your savings. Bear in mind that we are talking pennies here. I don't know how much the monthly bills that we are discussing here come to. Say it's $3,000. I think that would be a lot for most people. You say you're getting 3.6% on your savings. So if, on the average, you pay a bill 2 weeks later than you might have, you're getting an extra 2 \/ 52 x 3.6% x $3,000 in interest, or $4 per month. I think the last time I paid a late fee on a credit card it was $35, so if you make one mistake every 8 months and end up getting a late fee it will outweigh any savings.  Personally, I pay most of my bills through either my bank's web site or the biller's web site. I schedule all payments when I get a paycheck, and I generally try to schedule them for 1 week before the due date, so there's plenty of breathing room."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is generally not a good idea to pay your credit card bills at the last possible moment, as this can lead to late fees and damage to your credit score. It is important to pay your credit card bills on time, and it is generally best to pay them as soon as you can. This will help you avoid late fees and negative impacts on your credit score.If you are trying to maximize your savings, it may be a good idea to pay off your credit card balance in full each month, rather than carrying a balance from month to month. This will help you avoid paying interest on your balance, which can be expensive over time.

{"question":"For insurance, why should you refuse $4,000\/year for only 10 years and prefer $500\/year indefinitely?","human_answers":["The breakeven amount isn't at 8 years. You calculated how many years of paying $500 it would take to break even with one year of paying $4000. 8 x 10 years = 80 years. So by paying $500\/year it will take you 80 years to have spent the same amount ($40000 total) as you did in 10 years. At this point it may seem obvious what the better choice is. Consider where you'll be after 10 years: In scenario #1 you've spent $5000 ($500*10) and have to continue spending $500\/year indefinitely. In scenario #2 you've spent $40000 ($4000*10) and don't have to pay any more, but you currently have $35000 ($40000 - $5000) less than you did in scenario #1. If you had stayed with scenario #1 you could invest that $35000 at a measly 1.43% annual return and cover the $500 payments indefinitely without ever dipping into your remaining $35000. Most likely over the long term you'll do better than 1.43% per year and come out far ahead."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is generally not advisable to refuse a lump sum payment in favor of a smaller annual payment for an indefinite period of time. The lump sum payment of $4,000 per year for 10 years is a fixed amount that you can rely on and plan your finances around, while the smaller annual payment of $500 indefinitely may not provide enough financial security and may not be sufficient to meet your future needs.There are several factors that you should consider when deciding between a lump sum payment and an annual payment. One important factor is the time value of money, which means that the value of money decreases over time due to inflation. This means that $4,000 today may be worth more than the same amount in the future due to the impact of inflation.Another factor to consider is the opportunity cost of the money. If you accept the lump sum payment, you may be able to invest it and potentially earn a return on your investment. On the other hand, if you accept the smaller annual payment, you may not have the opportunity to invest the money and potentially earn a return.Overall, it is important to carefully consider the terms of any financial offer and how it will impact your financial security and future needs before making a decision."]},

The key here is that you need to find a solution that works for you two without an overt amount of effort.  So in a sense it is somewhat behavior driven, but it is also technology driven.   My wife and I use spreadsheets for both checking account management and budgeting.  A key time saver is that we have a template sheet that gets copied and pasted, then modified for the current month.  Typically 90% of the stuff is the same and each month requires very little modification.  This is one of my problems with EveryDollar.  I have to enter everything each and every month. We also have separate checking accounts and responsibility for different areas of the family expenses.  Doing this risks that we act as roommates, but we both clearly understand the money in one persons account equally belongs to the other and during hard times had to make up for shortfalls on the part of the other. Also we use cash for groceries, eating out, and other day to day expenses.  So we don't have a great need to track expenses or enter transactions. That is what works for us, and it takes us very little time to manage our money.  The budget meeting normally lasts less than a half hour and that includes goal tracking. We kind of live by the 80\/20 principle.  We don't see a value in tracking where every dime went.

{"question":"How exactly does a country devalue its currency? ","human_answers":["Currencies that are pegged or fixed require that foreign currencies are held by the central issuer at a proportional amount. This is analogous to having a portfolio of currencies that the central bank issues shares from - in the form of its own currency. We will continue with this analogy, if the central bank says these \"shares\" are worth $1, but the underlying components of the portfolio are worth $0.80 and decreasing, then it is expensive for the central bank to maintain its peg, and eventually they will have to disregard the peg as people start questioning the central bank's solvency. (People will know the $1 they hold is not really worth what the central bank says it is, because of the price changes people experience in buying goods and services, especially when it comes to imports. Shadow economies will also trade using a currency more reflective of labor, which happens no matter what the government's punishments are for doing so). Swiss National Bank (central bank) did this in early 2015, as it experienced volatility in the Euro which it had previously been trying to keep it's currency pegged to. It became too expensive for it to keep this peg on its own. The central bank can devalue its currency by adjusting the proportions of the reserve, such as selling a lot of foreign currency X, buying more of currency Y. They can and do take losses doing this. (Swiss National Bank is maintaining a large loss) They can also flood their economy with more of their currency, diluting the value of each individual 1 dollar equivalent. This is done by issuing bonds or monetizing goods and services from the private sector in exchange for bonds. People colloquially call this \"printing money\" but it is a misnomer in this day and age where printers are not relevant tools. The good and service goes onto the central bank's balance book, and the company\/entity that provided the service now has a bond on its book which can be immediately sold to someone else for cash (another reading is that the bond is as good as cash). The bond didn't previously exist until the central bank said it did, and central banks can infinitely exchange goods and services for bonds. Bond monetization (also called Quantitative Easing) is practiced by the Federal Reserve in the United States, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and now the Central Bank of the Republic of China"],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several ways that a country can devalue its currency. One way is for the central bank of the country to sell its own currency in the foreign exchange market and buy foreign currencies in exchange. This can lead to a decrease in the supply of the domestic currency and an increase in the demand for foreign currencies, which can cause the value of the domestic currency to decrease relative to the foreign currencies.Another way that a country can devalue its currency is by changing the exchange rate regime it uses. For example, if a country is using a fixed exchange rate system and the value of its currency is no longer sustainable, the central bank may decide to switch to a floating exchange rate system, which allows the market to determine the value of the currency. This can also lead to a decrease in the value of the currency.Finally, a country may devalue its currency by implementing economic policies that lead to inflation. If the domestic currency is experiencing high inflation relative to other currencies, the value of the domestic currency may decrease as a result."]},

{"question":"How does the debt:GDP ratio affect the country's economy? ","human_answers":["Is it not that bad? Depends how bad is bad. The problems causes by a government having large debt are similar to those caused by an individual having large debt. The big issue is: More and more of your income goes to paying interest on the debt, and is thus not available for spending on goods and services. If it gets bad enough, you find you cannot make payments, you start defaulting on loans, and then you have to make serious sacrifices, like selling your property to pay the debt. Nations have an advantage over individuals in that they can sometimes repudiate debt, i.e. simply declare that they are not going to pay. Lenders can then refuse to give them more money, but that doesn't get their original loans paid back. In theory other nations could send in troops to seize property to pay the loan, but this is a very extreme solution. Totally aside from any moral considerations, modern warfare is very expensive, it's likely the war would cost you more than you'd recover on the debt. How much debt is too much? It's hard to give a number, any more than one could give a \"maximum acceptable debt\" for an individual. American banks have a rule of thumb that they won't normally loan you money if your total debt payments would be more than 1\/3 of your income.

A performance fee is a type of fee that is paid to the fund manager based on the fund's investment performance over a certain period of time.The high water mark is the highest level of net asset value (NAV) that a mutual fund has reached. When the NAV of the mutual fund exceeds the high water mark, the fund manager may be eligible to receive a performance fee. The performance fee is usually a percentage of the excess returns above the high water mark. For example, if the mutual fund's NAV exceeds the high water mark by 10%, and the performance fee is 20%, the fund manager would receive a 2% fee based on the excess returns.The purpose of the high water mark is to ensure that the fund manager is only paid a performance fee when the mutual fund generates positive returns for its investors. If the mutual fund's NAV falls below the high water mark, the fund manager is not eligible to receive a performance fee until the NAV surpasses the high water mark again.

You can compare rates and terms from multiple lenders to find the one that's the most favorable for you.Consider alternative financing options: If you're unable to get an auto loan from a traditional lender, you may want to consider alternative financing options, such as a lease or a rent-to-own agreement. These options may have more flexible credit requirements, but they may also have higher costs in the long run.It's also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or immigration attorney if you have questions about your specific situation.

Here are a few steps you can take to increase your chances of getting an auto loan:Establish credit history: One of the main factors that lenders consider when deciding whether to approve an auto loan is your credit history. If you don't have a credit history in the United States, it may be more difficult to get a loan. You can try to establish credit by opening a credit card account or taking out a small loan and making timely payments.Provide proof of income: Lenders want to see that you have the financial means to make the monthly payments on an auto loan. You can increase your chances of getting approved by providing proof of your income, such as pay stubs or tax returns.Find a cosigner: If you don't have a credit history or sufficient income on your own, you may be able to get an auto loan by finding a cosigner who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and has a good credit history. The cosigner will be responsible for paying the loan if you are unable to do so.Shop around: It's a good idea to shop around and compare offers from different lenders to find the best deal.

If they exceed $4k, then payoff the interest bomb best buy card, then pay off the smaller ones, starting with the smaller balance.  That is the only tweak I will make here.

This is because the interest on the debt can add up quickly and make it more difficult to pay off the debt in the long run. If you have multiple debts with different interest rates, it is usually a good idea to focus on paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first, as this will save you the most money in the long run. If you are unable to pay off your debts in full, you may want to consider consolidating your debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, which can make it easier to manage your debts and pay them off more quickly.","It is generally a good idea to pay off a large amount of debt, rather than letting it snowball. Snowballing debt means allowing the balance to grow over time, either by not making payments or by only making minimum payments.

It can also reduce the overall amount of interest you pay on the debt, as the interest is typically calculated based on the balance.There are a few different strategies you can use to pay off a large amount of debt, such as the snowball method or the avalanche method.

{"question":"How can one relatively easily show that low expense ratio funds outperform high expense ratio funds?","human_answers":["I hope a wall of text with citations qualifies as \"relatively easy.\" Many of these studies are worth quoting at length. Long story short, a great deal of research has found that actively-managed funds underperform market indexes and passively-managed funds because of their high turnover and higher fees, among other factors.  Longer answer: Chris is right in stating that survivorship bias presents a problem for such research; however, there are several academic papers that address the survivorship problem, as well as the wider subject of active vs. passive performance. I'll try to provide a brief summary of some of the relevant literature.  The seminal paper that started the debate is Michael Jensen's 1968 paper titled \"The Performance of Mutual Funds in the Period 1945-1964\". This is the paper where Jensen's alpha, the ubiquitous measure of the performance of mutual fund managers, was first defined. Using a dataset of 115 mutual fund managers, Jensen finds that The evidence on mutual fund performance indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buy-the-market-and-hold policy, but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance. Although this paper doesn't address problems of survivorship, it's notable because, among other points, it found that managers who actively picked stocks performed worse even when fund expenses were ignored. Since actively-managed funds tend to have higher expenses than passive funds, the actual picture looks even worse for actively managed funds. A more recent paper on the subject, which draws similar conclusions, is Martin Gruber's 1996 paper \"Another puzzle: The growth in actively managed mutual funds\". Gruber calls it \"a puzzle\" that investors still invest in actively-managed funds, given that their performance on average has been inferior to that of index funds. He addresses survivorship bias by tracking funds across the entire sample, including through mergers. Since most mutual funds that disappear are merged into existing funds, he assumes that investors in a fund that disappear choose to continue investing their money in the fund that resulted from the merger. Using this assumption and standard measures of mutual fund performance, Gruber finds that mutual funds underperform an appropriately weighted average of the indices by about 65 basis points per year. Expense ratios for my sample averaged 113 basis points a year. These numbers suggest that active management adds value, but that mutual funds charge the investor more than the value added. Another nice paper is Mark Carhart's 1997 paper \"On persistence in mutual fund performance\" uses a sample free of survivorship bias because it includes \"all known equity funds over this period.\" It's worth quoting parts of this paper in full: I demonstrate that expenses have at least a one-for-one negative impact on fund performance, and that turnover also negatively impacts performance. ... Trading reduces performance by approximately 0.95% of the trade's market value.  In reference to expense ratios and other fees, Carhart finds that The investment costs of expense ratios, transaction costs, and load fees all have a direct, negative impact on performance. The study also finds that funds with abnormally high returns last year usually have higher-than-expected returns next year, but not in the following years, because of momentum effects. Lest you think the news is all bad, Russ Wermer's 2000 study \"Mutual fund performance: An empirical decomposition into stock\u2010picking talent, style, transactions costs, and expenses\" provides an interesting result. He finds that many actively-managed mutual funds hold stocks that outperform the market, even though the net return of the funds themselves underperforms passive funds and the market itself.  On a net-return level, the funds underperform broad market indexes by one percent a year. Of the 2.3% difference between the returns on stock holdings and the net returns of the funds, 0.7% per year is due to the lower average returns of the nonstock holdings of the funds during the period (relative to stocks). The remaining 1.6% per year is split almost evenly between the expense ratios and the transaction costs of the funds. The final paper I'll cite is a 2008 paper by Fama and French (of the Fama-French model covered in business schools) titled, appropriately, \"Mutual Fund Performance\". The paper is pretty technical, and somewhat above my level at this time of night, but the authors state one of their conclusions bluntly quite early on: After costs (that is, in terms of net returns to investors) active investment is a negative sum game.  Emphasis mine. In short, expense ratios, transaction costs, and other fees quickly diminish the returns to active investment. They find that The [value-weight] portfolio of mutual funds that invest primarily in U.S. equities is close to the market portfolio, and estimated before fees and expenses, its alpha is close to zero. Since the [value-weight] portfolio of funds produces an \u03b1 close to zero in gross returns, the alpha estimated on the net returns to investors is negative by about the amount of fees and expenses. This implies that the higher the fees, the farther alpha decreases below zero. Since actively-managed mutual funds tend to have higher expense ratios than passively-managed index funds, it's safe to say that their net return to the investor is worse than a market index itself. I don't know of any free datasets that would allow you to research this, but one highly-regarded commercial dataset is the CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund Database from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago. In financial research, CRSP is one of the \"gold standards\" for historical market data, so if you can access that data (perhaps for a firm or academic institution, if you're affiliated with one that has access), it's one way you could run some numbers yourself."],"chatgpt_answers":["There is a strong body of evidence that suggests that low expense ratio funds tend to outperform high expense ratio funds over the long term. This is because the higher fees associated with high expense ratio funds can eat into investment returns, reducing the overall performance of the fund.One way to demonstrate this relationship is to compare the returns of low expense ratio funds to those of high expense ratio funds over a long period of time, such as 10 years or more. This can be done using publicly available data from a reliable source, such as a mutual fund database or financial news website.To make the comparison more meaningful, it is important to select low expense ratio and high expense ratio funds that are similar in other ways, such as asset class, investment style, and risk level. This will help ensure that any differences in performance are due to the expense ratio rather than other factors.Once you have gathered the necessary data, you can use a tool such as a spreadsheet or charting software to create a graph or chart that illustrates the performance of the low expense ratio and high expense ratio funds over time. This can help make it easier to see the difference in performance and understand the impact of the expense ratio on fund returns.It is worth noting that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, so it is important to consider other factors in addition to expense ratio when selecting an investment. However, the evidence suggests that low expense ratio funds tend to outperform high expense ratio funds over the long term, making them a good choice for many investors."]},
{"question":"What percent of my salary should I save?","human_answers":["Its been years since I lived there, but I found Seattle to be pretty expensive.  Housing costs seem out of line with expected salaries.  Coming from Puerto Rico you might be shocked how expensive it is to live there, and also how infrequently you see the sun.

Also where you live in the Seattle area makes a difference.  Will you be in Redmond or Bothell?  Housing costs vary considerably. One nice thing about that part of the country is can be very inexpensive to vacation.  A fishing license, a packed lunch, and a bit of gas is all that is necessary to really enjoy that part of the country.

{"question":"Investment time horizon: When is it acceptable to withdraw money from investments?","human_answers":["To summarize your starting situation: You want to: Possible paths: No small business Get a job. Invest the 300K in safe liquid investments then move the maximum amount each year into your retirement accounts. Depending on which company you work for that could include 401K (Regular or Roth), deductible IRA, Roth IRA. The amount of money you can transfer is a function of the options they give you, how much they match, and the amount of income you earn. For the 401K you will invest from your paycheck, but pull an equal amount from the remainder of the 300K. If you are married you can use the same procedure for your spouse's account.

{"question":"Is it impossible to get a home loan with a poor credit history after a divorce?","human_answers":["No, it is never impossible to get credit so long as there are no price controls or quotas. In most of the United States, the impetus for housing is so strong that it's one sector of credit that has nearly no price regulation, price in this case being interest rates. Corporate banks will not touch you now because Dodd-Frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage.  Also, Fannie & Freddie, who ultimately finance most mortgages in the US now require banks to buy back loans if they fail, so banks are only financing the most creditworthy. All is not lost because markets are like rivers if not fully dammed: they find a way through. In your case, you can get a fully-financed mortgage if you're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit. If the foreclosure process is quick and benefits the lender more in your state, the interest rate will be even lower. Your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions.  If you shop around, you'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get. Also, since the cost of your prospective home is so low, it's very easy for an investor flush with cash and few investments to take a flier on a mother committed to her children who only needs $50,000.

I didn't put a huge amount of money there I had to live there for 1 year or some more. Maybe if i deposited a huge amount of money someone would have come to ask me how did I make all those money, but those money were legally generated by me working in Italy before so I didn't have anything to be afraid about. BTW: in Italy I was thinking to move money to a German bank in Germany. The risk of default is a nightmare, something of completly new now in UE compared to the past where each state had its own currency. According to Muro history says that in case of default it happened that some government prevented people from withdrawing money form bank accounts: \"Yes, historically governments have   shut down banks to prevent people from   withdrawing their money in times of   crisis. See Argentina circa 2001 or US   during Great Depression. The   government prevented people from   withdrawing their money and people   could do nothing while their money   rapidly lost value.\" but in case Greece prevents people from withdrwaing money, those money are still in EURO, so i'm wondering what would be the effect.

Here are a few potential options:Transfer the funds to a bank account in the UK: One option would be to simply transfer the funds from a Greek bank account to a bank account in the UK. This can usually be done through online banking or by visiting a bank branch. Keep in mind that you may need to pay fees for the transfer, and the exchange rate may not be favorable.Use a money transfer service: There are a number of companies that specialize in transferring money between countries, such as TransferWise or Xoom. These services can often be more convenient and faster than transferring money through a bank, but they may also have higher fees.Open a new bank account in the UK: If you are planning to move to the UK permanently or spend a significant amount of time there, you may want to consider opening a new bank account in the UK. This will allow you to easily access your funds and manage them from the UK.It's important to consider the potential risks and benefits of each option before making a decision.

{"question":"Is it better for a public company to increase its dividends, or institute a share buyback?","human_answers":["I would prefer a dividend paying company, rather than share appreciation. And I would prefer that the dividends increase over time."],"chatgpt_answers":["It depends on the circumstances and the company's financial situation. Both increasing dividends and instituting a share buyback can be ways for a company to return value to its shareholders. However, there are trade-offs to consider for each option.One benefit of increasing dividends is that it provides a regular source of income for shareholders. This can be particularly appealing for investors who rely on the dividends for their income or for those who are looking for a steady stream of returns from their investments. However, increasing dividends can also put pressure on a company's cash flow, as it requires the company to pay out a portion of its profits on a regular basis.On the other hand, instituting a share buyback allows a company to buy back its own shares from the market, which can help to increase the value of the remaining shares by reducing the total number of outstanding shares. This can be a good option for a company that has a strong balance sheet and is looking to return excess cash to shareholders. However, share buybacks can also be seen as a sign that the company doesn't have any good investment opportunities or that management is not confident in the company's future growth prospects.Ultimately, the decision of whether to increase dividends or institute a share buyback will depend on a variety of factors, including the company's financial situation, its long-term growth prospects, and the preferences of its shareholders."]},

{"question":"Does high frequency trading provide economic value? ","human_answers":["You pointed out that HFT does not create ipods are mine minerals.  Neither does human trading. HFT is a proxy for human trading.  Although the computer is executing trades automatically based on an algorithm, it is still using money from a human being's account so the trading is still being done with someone's money. Fast execution of trades is desirable in exchanges.  Imagine two exchanges:  One only executes trades once a month, the other executes trades once a week.  Which exchange would be more desirable?  The exchange that trades once a week.  Why?  Because if I'm holding a stock that I would like to sell, I want to sell it now - not a month from now.  Same reason for buying.  This concept works all the way down to seconds and fractions of seconds. The issue with HFT, however, is there are cases where the market goes against the HFT algorithm and the algorithm continues to execute trades driving prices up or down by large amounts in the matter of minutes or even seconds. The exchange frequently cancels these trades which only encourages more aggressive HFT trading since HFT traders can have their losses cancelled.  This is a privilege that LFTs (low frequency traders) do not receive.  This is a valid criticism of HFTs. A short list of such cancelled trades: 8\/26\/2010: Nasdaq cancels trades of CORE stock 10\/4\/2010: Nasdaq cancels trades of CENX stock 10\/15\/2010: NYSE cancels trades of PAY stock 10\/18\/2010: NYSE cancels $500 million worth of SPY trades 5\/18\/2011: NYSE cancels 15,900 trades of BEE.PR.C 6\/21\/2011: Nasdaq cancels CNTY trades 12\/2\/2011: London Metals Exchange cancel trades of copper"],"chatgpt_answers":["High-frequency trading (HFT) refers to the use of computer algorithms to execute trades at very high speeds, often in the range of microseconds or less. HFT is typically characterized by the use of high-speed data feeds, low latency connectivity, and specialized hardware and software to enable rapid trade execution. HFT has been a controversial topic, with some arguing that it provides liquidity and other efficiencies to financial markets, while others claim that it can lead to market manipulation and instability.One argument in favor of HFT is that it helps to increase liquidity in financial markets by providing a source of demand and supply for securities. HFT firms may also provide price discovery services, helping to identify the fair value of securities and contributing to price efficiency. Additionally, HFT can help to reduce the cost of trading for investors by providing competition among market makers and contributing to tighter spreads between bid and ask prices.However, some critics argue that HFT can contribute to market instability and unfairness. For example, HFT firms may be able to execute trades faster than other traders, giving them an advantage in certain market conditions. There have also been concerns about the potential for HFT firms to engage in manipulative or predatory practices, such as placing and then quickly canceling orders in order to create the appearance of market activity or to manipulate prices.Overall, the economic value of HFT is a matter of debate. Some argue that it provides liquidity and efficiency to financial markets, while others believe that it can contribute to instability and unfairness.

For example, a company may only pay dividends on a quarterly or annual basis, rather than making payments every month.Finally, it's also possible that the company may have a waiting period before paying dividends, during which time it is holding onto the funds in order to ensure that it has the necessary liquidity to meet its other financial obligations.Overall, the specific timing of dividend payments can vary depending on the company and the specific circumstances involved.","Dividends are typically paid out a few weeks after the ex-dividend date, which is the date on which a stock begins trading without the dividend. This is because it takes time to process the dividend payments and make sure that the correct amount of money is going to the right shareholders. The exact length of time it takes to pay dividends can vary depending on the company and the dividend payment method. Some companies may pay dividends on a quarterly or annual basis, while others may pay them monthly or semi-annually. The payment method can also impact the timing of dividend payments, as dividends paid by check or bank transfer may take longer to process than those paid through electronic means."]},

{"question":"Why does gold have value?","human_answers":["Gold can be thought of to have value in one of two ways; (1) as a means and (2) as an end.  Means takes the shape of currency.

As a medium of exchange, gold has no definitive value and is only assigned one during the process of an exchange. For example, I would be valuing one ingot of gold to be worth a dog if I traded a dog for one ingot of gold. The value of gold in this sense is subjective as each person decides for themselves what gold is worth during the transaction. Gold as an end is valued for its own sake. A good example of this is a jeweler who purchases gold directly because of the intrinsic property(s) gold possesses. This is closer to the \"true value\" of gold than using it as a means, but virtually no one in our society views gold in this manor because virtually no one can use gold in this manor. \"You know what I could use right now, a block of gold.\" - said no one ever.  But even if you are one of the select few who value gold for its own sake, this is usually done because gold provides a function. For example, if people no longer want to ware jewelry, then a jeweler will likely have to find a new line of work where he would likely no longer view gold as valuable as an ends.

{"question":"Can I profit from selling a PUT on BBY?","human_answers":["Yes, theoretically you can flip the shares you agreed to buy and make a profit, but you're banking on the market behaving in some very precise and potentially unlikely ways.  In practice it's very tricky for you to successfully navigate paying arbitrarily more for a stock than it's currently listed for, and selling it back again for enough to cover the difference.  Yes, the price could drop to $28, but it could just as easily drop to $27.73 (or further) and now you're hurting, before even taking into account the potentially hefty commissions involved. Another way to think about it is to recognize that an option transaction is a bet; the buyer is betting a small amount of money that a stock will move in the direction they expect, the seller is betting a large amount of money that the same stock will not.  One of you has to lose.  And unless you've some reason to be solidly confident in your predictive powers the loser, long term, is quite likely to be you. Now that said, it is possible (particularly when selling puts) to create win-win scenarios for yourself, where you're betting one direction, but you'd be perfectly happy with the alternative(s).   Here's an example.  Suppose, unrelated to the option chain, you've come to the conclusion that you'd be happy paying $28 for BBY.  It's currently (June 2011) at ~$31, so you can't buy it on the open market for a price you'd be happy with.  But you could sell a $28 put, promising to buy it at that price should someone want to sell it (presumably, because the price is now below $28). Either the put expires worthless and you pocket a few bucks and you're basically no worse off because the stock is still overpriced by your estimates, or the option is executed, and you receive 100 shares of BBY at a price you previously decided you were willing to pay.  Even if the list price is now lower, long term you expect the stock to be worth more than $28.  Conceptually, this makes selling a put very similar to being paid to place a limit order to buy the stock itself. Of course, you could be wrong in your estimate (too low, and you now have a position that might not become profitable; too high, and you never get in and instead just watch the stock gain in value), but that is not unique to options - if you're bad at estimating value (which is not to be confused with predicting price movement) you're doomed just about whatever you do."],"chatgpt_answers":["Yes, it is possible to profit from selling a put option on BBY, also known as writing a put. When you sell a put, you agree to buy a stock at a certain price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiration date). In return, you receive a premium from the buyer of the put option.If the stock price remains above the strike price before the expiration date, the put option will expire worthless and you will keep the premium as profit. However, if the stock price falls below the strike price before the expiration date, the put option may be exercised, which means you will be required to buy the stock at the strike price. If you do not already own the stock, you will need to purchase it at the current market price, which could be higher than the strike price. In this case, you will incur a loss equal to the difference between the strike price and the market price, minus the premium you received.It's important to understand the risks involved in selling a put before you decide to do so. The stock price can move significantly and unexpectedly, which can affect the profitability of the option. Additionally, you should have the financial means to buy the stock if the put option is exercised. It's a good idea to carefully consider your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation before deciding whether selling a put is appropriate for you."]},

This means that if you own shares of a company that is issuing a dividend or conducting a stock split, the adjustment will typically be made to your account after the market closes on the day the dividend or split is effective.For example, if a company announces that it will pay a dividend on December 31, the dividend will typically be paid to shareholders on the ex-dividend date, which is typically one or two business days before the payment date. If you own shares of the company on the ex-dividend date, you will be entitled to receive the dividend. The dividend will be paid to your brokerage account or directly to you, depending on how you have your account set up.Similarly, if a company announces that it will conduct a stock split, the split will typically be effective on a specific date, and the adjustment will be made to your account after the market closes on that date. If the company is conducting a 2-for-1 stock split, for example, you will receive an additional share for each share you own, and the price of the shares will be adjusted accordingly.It's important to note that the exact timing of dividends and stock splits can vary, so it's always a good idea to check with your brokerage or the company itself for specific details."]},

{"question":"Will I be able to purchase land?","human_answers":["Here are some important things to think about.  Alan and Denise Fields discuss them in more detail in Your New House. Permanent work.  Where do you want to live?  Are there suitable jobs nearby?  How much do they pay? Emergency fund.  Banks care that you have \"reserves\" (and\/or an unsecured line of credit) in case you have a run of bad luck.  This also helps with float the large expenses when closing a loan. Personal line of credit. Who are you building for?  If you are not married, then you should consider whether building a home makes that easier, or harder.  If you hope to have kids, you should consider whether your home will make it easier to have kids, or harder.  If you are married (or seriously considering it), make sure that your spouse helps with the shopping, and is in agreement on the priorities and choices.  If you are not married, then what will you do if\/when you get married?  Will you sell?  expand?  build another house on the same lot?  rent the home out? Total budget.  How much can the lot, utilities, permits, taxes, financing charges, building costs, and contingency allowance come to?  Talk with a banker about how much you can afford.  Talk with a build-on-your-lot builder about how much house you can get for that budget.  Consider a new mobile or manufactured home.  But if you do choose one, ask your banker how that affects what you can borrow, and how it affects your rates and terms.  Talk with a good real estate agent about how much the resale value might be. Finished lot budget. How much can you budget for the lot, utilities, permits required to get zoning approval, fees, interest, and taxes before you start construction? Down payment.  It sounds like you have a plan for this. Loan underwriting.  Talk with a good bank loan officer about what their expectations are.  Ask about the \"front-end\" and \"back-end\" Debt-To-Income ratios.  In Oregon, I recommend Washington Federal for lot loans and construction loans.  They keep all of their loans, and service the loans themselves.  They use appraisers who are specially trained in evaluating new home construction.  Their appraisers tend to appraise a bit low, but not ridiculously low like the incompetent appraisers used by some other banks in the area.  (I know two banks with lots of Oregon branches that use an appraiser who ignores 40% of the finished, heated area of some to-be-built homes.)  Avoid any institution (including USAA and NavyFed) that outsources their lending to PHH. Lot loan.  In Oregon, Washington Federal offers lot loans with 30% down payments, 20-year amortization, and one point, on approved credit.  The interest rate can be a fixed rate, but is typically a few percentage points per year higher than for a mortgage secured by a permanent house.  If you have the financial wherewithal to start building within two years, Washington Federal also offers short-term lot loans.  Ask about the costs of appraisals, points, and recording fees. Rent.  How much will it cost to rent a place to live, between when you move back to Oregon, and when your new home is ready to move into? Commute.  How much time will it take to get from your new home to work?  How much will it cost?  (E.g., car ownership, depreciation, maintenance, insurance, taxes, fuel?  If public transportation is an option, how much will it cost?) Lot availability.  How many are there to choose from?  Can you talk a farmer into selling off a chunk of land?  Can you homestead government land?  How much does a lot cost?  Is it worth getting a double lot (or an extra large lot)? Utilities. Do you want to live off the grid?  Are you willing to make the choices needed to do that?  (E.g., well, generator, septic system, satellite TV and telephony, fuel storage)  If not, how much will it cost to connect to such systems?  (For practical purposes, subtract twice the value of these installation costs from the cost of a finished lot, when comparing lot deals.) Easements. These provide access to your property, access for others through your property, and affect your rights.  Utility companies often ask for far more rights than they need.  Until you sign on the dotted line, you can negotiate them down to just what they need.  Talk to a good real estate attorney. Zoning. How much will you be allowed to build?  (In terms of home square footage, garage square footage, roof area, and impermeable surfaces.)  How can the home be used?  (As a business, as a farm, how many unrelated people can live there, etc.)  What setbacks are required?  How tall can the building(s) be?  Are there setbacks from streams, swamps, ponds, wetlands, or steep slopes? Choosing a builder.  For construction loans, banks want builders who will build what is agreed upon, in a timely fashion.  If you want to build your own house, talk to your loan officer about what the bank expects in a builder. Plansets and permits.  The construction loan process. If you hire a general contractor, and if you have difficulties with the contractor, you might be forced to refuse to accept some work as being complete.  A good bank will back you up.  Ask about points, appraisal charges, and inspection fees. Insurance during construction.  Some companies have good plans -- if the construction takes 12 months or less.  Some (but not all) auto insurance companies also offer good homeowners' insurance for homes under construction.  Choose your auto insurance company accordingly. Property taxes. Don't forget to include them in your post-construction budget. Homeowners' insurance.  Avoid properties that need flood insurance.  Apply a sanity check to flood maps -- some of them are unrealistic.  Strongly consider earthquake insurance.  Don't forget to include these costs in your post-construction budget. Energy costs.  Some jurisdictions require you to calculate how large a heating system you need.  Do not trust their design temperatures -- they may not allow for enough heating during a cold snap, especially if you have a heat pump.  (Some heat pumps work at -10\u00b0F -- but most lose their effectiveness between 10\u00b0F and 25\u00b0F.)  You can use these calculations, in combination with the number of \"heating degree days\" and \"cooling degree days\" at your site, to accurately estimate your energy bills.  If you choose a mobile or manufactured home, calculate how much extra its energy bills will be. Home design.  Here are some good sources of ideas: A Pattern Language, by Christopher Alexander.  Alexander emphasizes building homes and neighborhoods that can grow, and that have niches within niches within niches. The Not-So-Big House, by Sarah Susanka.  This book applies many Alexander's design patterns to medium and large new houses. Before the Architect.  The late Ralph Pressel emphasized the importance of plywood sheathing, flashing, pocket doors, wide hallways, wide stairways, attic trusses, and open-truss or I-joist floor systems.  Lots of outlets and incandescent lighting are good too.  (It is possible to have too much detail in a house plan, and too much room in a house.  For examples, see any of his plans.)

{"question":"Can stock market gains be better protected under an LLC arrangement?","human_answers":["The thing you get wrong is that you think the LLC doesn't pay taxes on gains when it sells assets.  It does. In fact, in many countries LLC are considered separate entities for tax properties and you have double taxation - the LLC pays its own taxes, and then when you withdraw the money from the LLC to your own account (i.e.: take dividends) - you pay income tax on the withdrawal again. Corporate entities usually do not have preferential tax treatment for investments. In the US, LLC is a pass-though entity (unless explicitly chosen to be taxed as a corporation, and then the above scenario happens). Pass-through entities (LLCs and partnerships) don't pay taxes, but instead report the gains to the owners, which then pay taxes as if the transaction was their personal one. So if you're in the US - investing under LLC would have no effect whatsoever on your taxes, or adverse effect if you chose to treat it as a corporation. In any case, investing in stocks is not a deductible expense, and as such doesn't reduce profits."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is possible to use a limited liability company (LLC) to hold stock investments in order to provide some protection for those investments.

{"question":"When to trade in a relatively new car for maximum value","human_answers":["I love giving non-answer answers.  It will depend on you.  Suppose you are embarrassed by driving older cars, your significant other doesn't like having you drive an older car, you don't really maintain the car well, it develops a variety of problems, acquires a few dents and you really worry about reliability.  Then the value of the car will probably drop rather quickly below the blue book value and you should sell it. On the other hand, if you don't care how the car looks, it runs pretty well (fewer repairs than you would expect), you maintain it yourself (aka cheaply) and do a good job at that, and have plenty of friends who owe you a favor and will give you a ride if your car won't start, there will probably never be a time that the value to you drops below the 'official' blue book value (what others will pay), so you would drive it until the engine drops out of the chassis.  The blue book value represents some kind of rough consensus about what a car of that age and exterior condition is worth to the typical person; it will be the discrepancy between the 'typical' person and you that determines whether you'll sell. An illustration of this:  I know a few people who (1) don't care what their car looks like and (2) are very handy at repairs.  These people started out by buying cheap used cars and ran them until they basically fell to pieces.  However, even though their 'taste' in cars didn't changes, as their incomes increased, it finally reached the point where doing their own repairs was too much of a time sink, so the value of really old cars dropped in their minds and they shifted to buying newer cars and selling them before they completely fell apart.  That's why this is a hard question to answer."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a few factors to consider when deciding when to trade in a relatively new car for maximum value.Age: The age of the car is an important factor in determining its value.

This means that the longer you hold onto the car, the less it will be worth.Condition: The condition of the car also plays a role in its value. A car that is well-maintained and has a clean history will generally be worth more than a car that has been in accidents or has a lot of wear and tear.Market demand: The demand for the car in the market can also affect its value. If the car is in high demand, it may be worth more than if it is not as popular.In general, it is a good idea to trade in a car when it is relatively new and in good condition, as this will likely get you the most value for it.

{"question":"Can the U.S. government retroactively tax gains made earlier in the fiscal year?","human_answers":["You're certainly referring to \"Ex Post Facto\" laws, and while the US is constitutionally prohibited from passing criminal laws that are retroactive, the US Supreme Court has upheld many tax laws that apply tax code changes retroactively. You might ask a similar question on Law.SE for a more thorough treatment of the legalities of congress passing those laws, but I will stick to the personal finance portion of the question. What this means is that you can't expect that the current tax laws will be in force in the future, and your investment\/retirement plans should be as flexible as possible. You may wish to have some money in both Roth and traditional 401(k) accounts. You might not want to have millions of dollars in Roth accounts, because if congress does act to limit the tax benefits of those accounts, it will probably be targeting the larger balances.

Similarly, if you sell an asset and realize a gain in 2021, that gain is generally taxable in 2021, regardless of when you actually receive the payment for the sale.There are some exceptions to this general rule, such as in the case of installment sales, where the gain is recognized over a period of time rather than all at once. However, in general, the U.S. tax system operates on a cash basis, which means that income is taxable in the year it is received or earned, and expenses are deductible in the year they are paid.It is also worth noting that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has the authority to audit taxpayers and assess additional taxes if it determines that a taxpayer has underreported their income or improperly claimed deductions or credits.

{"question":"Should I pay off my 401k loan or reinvest the funds elsewhere?","human_answers":["This summer I used a loan from my 401(k) to help pay for the down payment of a new house. We planned on selling a Condo a few months later, so we only needed the loan for a short period but wanted to keep monthly payments low since we would be paying two mortgages for a few months. I also felt like the market might take a dip in the future, so I liked the idea of trying to cash out high and buy back low (spoiler alert: this didn't happen). So in July 2017 I withdrew $17,000 from my account (Technically $16,850.00 principal and $150 processing fee) at an effective 4.19% APR (4% rate and then the fee), with 240 scheduled payments of $86.00 (2 per month for 10 years). Over the lifetime of the loan the total finance charge was $3,790, but that money would be paid back into my account. I was happy with the terms, and it helped tide things over until the condo was sold a few months later. But then I decided to change jobs, and ended up having to pay back the loan ~20 weeks after it was issued (using the proceeds from the sale of the condo). During this time the market had done well, so when I paid back the funds the net difference in shares that I now owned (including shares purchased with the interest payments) was $538.25 less than today's value of the original count of shares that were sold to fund the loan. Combined with the $150 fee, the overall \"cost\" of the 20 week loan was about 4.05%. That isn't the interest rate (interest was paid back to my account balance), but the value lost due to the principal having been withdrawn. On paper, my account would be worth that much more if I hadn't withdrawn the money. Now if you extrapolate the current market return into 52 weeks, you can think of that loan having an APR \"cost\" of around 10.5% (Probably not valid for a multi year calculation, but seems accurate for a 12 month projection). Again, that is not interest paid back to the account, but instead the value lost due to the money not being in the account. Sure, the market could take a dip and I may be able to buy the shares back at a reduced cost, but that would require keeping sizable liquid assets around and trying to time the market. It also is not something you can really schedule very well, as the loan took 6 days to fund (not including another week of clarifying questions back\/forth before that) and 10 day to repay (from the time I initiated the paperwork to when the check was cashed and shares repurchased). So in my experience, the true cost of the loan greatly depends on how the market does, and if you have the ability to pay back the loan it probably is worth doing so. Especially since you may be forced to do so at any time if you change jobs or your employment is terminated."],"chatgpt_answers":["It's generally a good idea to pay off a 401(k) loan as soon as possible. Here are a few reasons why:Interest rates: Most 401(k) loans come with an interest rate that is higher than the rate of return you can expect from your investments. This means that you are essentially losing money by borrowing from your 401(k) instead of investing it.Risk: When you borrow from your 401(k), you are taking on additional risk. If you lose your job or leave the company, you may be required to repay the loan in a short period of time, which could be difficult if you don't have the money.Opportunity cost: By borrowing from your 401(k), you are missing out on the potential growth of your investments. If the market does well, you could be losing out on significant returns that could have helped you reach your financial goals.In general, it's a good idea to pay off debt as soon as possible, especially high-interest debt like credit card balances. If you have a 401(k) loan, it may be worth considering paying it off before investing in other opportunities. However, it's important to carefully consider your financial situation and make a decision that is right for you."]},

{"question":"Would there be tax implications if I used AirBnB as opposed to just renting out a unit normally?","human_answers":["Given your clarifying comment that you're asking about the length of stay rather than AirBnB in particular, I'd say there is a decent chance there will be tax differences.  The difference is unlikely to be in income tax, but many cities have local ordinances that impose transaction taxes on short stays.  For instance, the town where I live has a \"transient occupancy tax\" for any paid stay of less than 31 days. Unfortunately, because these taxes are often levied by individual cities, it's hard to know whether one applies in your case.  One town may impose no tax while the town right next to it does impose a tax.  You'll have to look at what your local laws are.  This could be easy if your town has a nice comprehensive website about local laws; if not you may have to do some deeper research. In any case, you should definitely look into it, since there could be penalities if there is a tax and the city finds out you're not paying it.  As AirBnB has grown in popularity, many municipalities have begun to crack down on AirBnB renters who try to make money without paying taxes like a regular motel (as well as conforming to other laws, e.g., running a business in a neighborhood zoned residential)."],"chatgpt_answers":["There may be tax implications for you if you use Airbnb to rent out a unit, as income from renting out a property is generally taxable. However, the specific tax implications will depend on your individual circumstances and the laws in your jurisdiction.In general, you will need to report any income you earn from renting out a property on your tax return. If you use Airbnb to rent out your property, you will need to keep records of the income you earn and any expenses you incur related to the rental property, such as cleaning or repair costs. You may be able to deduct some of these expenses when you file your taxes, which can help reduce your tax liability.It's important to note that the tax treatment of income from renting out a property can vary depending on how long you rent out the property and how often you do so. For example, if you only occasionally rent out a room in your home on Airbnb, you may be able to treat the income as \"rental income,\" which is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. On the other hand, if you frequently rent out your property on Airbnb, you may need to treat the income as \"business income,\" which is subject to different tax rules.It's a good idea to consult with a tax professional or review the tax laws in your jurisdiction to understand the specific tax implications of using Airbnb to rent out a property."]},
{"question":"How common are stock\/scrip dividends (as opposed to cash dividends) in US equity markets?","human_answers":["There's not usually a point to issuing new stock as a dividend, because if you issue new stock, it dilutes the existing shareholders by the exact same amount as the dividend: so now they have a few more shares, great, but they're worth the exact same amount. (This assumes that all stockholders are equal. If there are multiple share classes, or people whose rights to a stock are tied to the stock price in some manner - options, warrants, or something - then a properly structured stock dividend could serve to enrich one set of shareholders and other rights-holders at the expense of another. But this is usually illegal.) If this sort of dividends are popular in China, I suspect it is due to some freaky regulatory or tax-related circumstances which are not present in the United States markets. China is kind of notorious for having unusual capital controls, limitations on the exchange of currency, and markets which are not very transparent."],"chatgpt_answers":["Stock dividends, also known as scrip dividends, are a type of dividend payment in which a company distributes new shares of its stock to shareholders, rather than paying a cash dividend. Stock dividends are not very common in the U.S. equity markets, as most companies prefer to pay cash dividends to shareholders.There are several reasons why companies may choose to pay a stock dividend rather than a cash dividend. For example, a company may choose to pay a stock dividend if it does not have sufficient cash on hand to pay a cash dividend, or if it wants to conserve cash for other purposes, such as reinvesting in the business or paying down debt. A company may also choose to pay a stock dividend if it wants to increase the total number of shares outstanding, as this can help to increase the company's market capitalization and potentially improve its financial standing.It's worth noting that stock dividends are not considered taxable events for individual shareholders, as they do not receive any additional income from the dividend. However, shareholders will see a corresponding decrease in the value of their shares, as the number of shares outstanding increases. This can affect the shareholder's overall return on investment, as the value of their holdings will be spread out over a larger number of shares.Overall, while stock dividends are not very common in the U.S. equity markets, they can be an important tool for companies to distribute value to shareholders and manage their financial resources."]},

Here are a few ways that QE2 could potentially affect your bank account:Lower interest rates: One of the main goals of QE2 was to lower interest rates by increasing the supply of money in the economy. This could lead to lower interest rates on loans, including mortgages, car loans, and credit card debt, which could make borrowing cheaper for you.Higher asset prices: QE2 could also lead to higher asset prices, such as stocks and real estate, which could benefit you if you own these assets.Increased economic activity: QE2 could help stimulate economic growth, which could lead to an increase in demand for goods and services and potentially create more job opportunities. This could lead to higher income and potentially more money in your bank account.It's important to note that the effects of QE2 are complex and can vary depending on a variety of factors, so it's difficult to predict exactly how it will impact your specific bank account.

{"question":"Diversify or keep current stock to increase capital gains","human_answers":["The biggest challenge with owning any individual stock is price fluctuation, which is called risk. The scenarios you describe assume that the stock behaves exactly as you predict (price\/portfolio doubles) and you need to consider risk. One way to measure risk in a stock or in a portfolio is Sharpe Ratio (risk adjusted return), or the related Sortino ratio. One piece of advice that is often offered to individual investors is to diversify, and the stated reason for diversification is to reduce risk. But that is not telling the whole story. When you are able to identify stocks that are not price correlated, you can construct a portfolio that reduces risk. You are trying to avoid 10% tax on the stock grant (25%-15%), but need to accept significant risk to avoid the 10% differential tax ($1000). An alternative to a single stock is to invest in an ETF (much lower risk), which you can buy and hold for a long time, and the price\/growth of an ETF (ex. SPY) can be charted versus your stock to visualize the difference in growth\/fluctuation. Look up the beta (volatility) of your stock compared to SPY (for example, IBM). Compare the beta of IBM and TSLA and note that you may accept higher volatility when you invest in a stock like Tesla over IBM. What is the beta of your stock? And how willing are you to accept that risk? When you can identify stocks that move in opposite directions, and mix your portfolio (look up beta balanced portolio), you can smooth out the variability (reduce the risk), although you may reduce your absolute return. This cannot be done with a single stock, but if you have more money to invest you could compose the rest of your portfolio to balance the risk for this stock grant, keep the grant shares, and still effectively manage risk. Some years ago I had accumulated over 10,000 shares (grants, options) in a company where I worked. During the time I worked there, their price varied between $30\/share and < $1\/share. I was able to liquidate at $3\/share."],"chatgpt_answers":["It's generally a good idea to diversify your investments in order to spread risk and potentially increase the overall return on your investment portfolio.

On the other hand, if you have a shorter investment horizon or are risk-averse, it may be advisable to diversify your investments more broadly in order to mitigate risk.Ultimately, the decision to diversify or not will depend on your individual financial situation and investment goals.

{"question":"What exactly happens during a settlement period?","human_answers":["During the settlement period, the buyer transfers payment to the seller and the seller transfers ownership to the buyer. This is really a holdover from the days when so much of stock trading was done by individual human traders, and computers were still not a huge part of the operation.  Back then, paper tickets for trades exchanged hands, and the time period was actually 5 days, so 3 days is an improvement.   A settlement period was necessary for everyone to figure out their trades and do what was necessary to make the settlements happen, so it was not always a quick process, mainly because of smaller trading firms that didn't have technology to help them along. Nowadays, technology makes settlements easy, and they usually occur at the end of the trading day.

During this time, the parties involved in the trade are working to finalize the transaction and transfer ownership of the securities or financial instruments.There are several steps that typically take place during the settlement period:Confirmation: The parties involved in the trade confirm the details of the transaction, including the type and quantity of securities or financial instruments being traded, the price, and the settlement date.Clearing: The trade is submitted to a clearinghouse, which acts as a middleman to ensure that both parties fulfill their obligations under the trade. The clearinghouse checks that the parties have sufficient funds or securities to complete the trade, and if not, arranges for the necessary financing or securities to be provided.Delivery: The securities or financial instruments are delivered to the buyer and ownership is transferred. This is typically done through a central securities depository, which holds the securities electronically and transfers ownership through changes in its records.Payment: The payment for the securities or financial instruments is made by the buyer to the seller. This may be in the form of cash, a cash equivalent, or other securities or financial instruments.The length of the settlement period can vary depending on the type of securities or financial instruments being traded and the jurisdiction in which the trade takes place.

{"question":"Is there any real purpose in purchasing bonds?","human_answers":["You ask a question, \"Is there any real purpose in purchasing bonds?\" and then appear to go off on a rant. Before the question is closed by members here, let me offer this:  This chart reflects the 10 year bond rate. From 1960-2004 (give or take) the coupon rate was over 4%. Asset allocation suggests a mix of stocks and bonds seeking to avoid the risk of having \"all of one's eggs in one basket.\" To that end, the simplest approach is a stock\/bond mix. Over time, a 70\/30 mix provides nearly 95% of the long tern return, but with a much lower volatility.

Do you have data to back up this statement?"],"chatgpt_answers":["Bonds can serve a variety of purposes for investors. Some of the main reasons why investors might purchase bonds include:Income: One of the primary reasons people buy bonds is for the income they generate. When you buy a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for regular interest payments. These interest payments can provide a steady stream of income, which can be especially useful for retirees or other investors who rely on their investment portfolio for income.Diversification: Adding bonds to your investment portfolio can help to diversify your holdings and reduce risk. Because the prices of bonds and stocks tend to move in opposite directions, having a mix of both can help to smooth out the overall volatility of your portfolio.Safety: Another reason people buy bonds is for the relative safety they offer. While no investment is completely risk-free, bonds are generally considered to be less risky than stocks. This is because the issuer is obligated to pay the bondholder the principal and interest that is due.Capital appreciation: While the main focus of bonds is usually the income they generate, some investors also buy bonds with the hope of making a profit by selling them for more than they paid. This can occur if interest rates fall and the value of the bond rises as a result.Overall, the decision to purchase bonds should be based on your investment objectives and risk tolerance. It's important to understand the characteristics of different types of bonds and to diversify your bond holdings in order to manage risk.","Bonds can serve several purposes for investors. One common reason for purchasing bonds is for the income they generate.

In times of economic uncertainty or market volatility, bonds may be less risky than stocks and can provide a measure of stability to an investment portfolio.Another reason for purchasing bonds is to hedge against inflation. Inflation can erode the purchasing power of an investor's money over time, and some types of bonds, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), are designed to protect against this by providing a fixed rate of interest that is adjusted for inflation.Finally, bonds can be a useful tool for investors who are saving for specific goals, such as retirement or the education of their children.

{"question":"Electric car lease or buy?","human_answers":["I might be missing something, but I always understood that leasing is about managing cash-flow in a business. You have a fixed monthly out-going as opposed to an up-front payment. My accountant (here in Germany) recommended: pay cash, take a loan (often the manufactures offer good rates) or lease - in that order. The leasing company has to raise the cash from somewhere and they don't want to make a loss on the deal. They will probably know better than I how to manage that and will therefore be calculating in the projected resale value at the end of the leasing period. I can't see how an electric car would make any difference here. These people are probably better informed about the resale value of any type of car than I am. My feeling is to buy using a loan from the manufacturer. The rates are often good and I have also got good deals on insurance as a part of that package. Here in Germany the sales tax (VAT) can be immediately claimed back in full when the loan deal is signed."],"chatgpt_answers":["Whether you should lease or buy an electric car depends on your individual circumstances and financial situation. Here are some factors to consider when making your decision:Cost: Buying an electric car may have a higher upfront cost, but you may be able to negotiate a lower price if you are willing to pay cash or have a trade-in. Leasing may have a lower upfront cost, but you will be paying a monthly fee for the duration of the lease, which could be more expensive in the long run.Maintenance: When you own an electric car, you are responsible for all maintenance and repairs. If you lease an electric car, the maintenance and repair costs may be covered by the leasing company.Driving habits: If you drive a lot of miles or plan to keep the car for a long time, buying may be the better option. If you only drive a few miles per year or plan to upgrade to a newer model in a few years, leasing may be a better fit.Tax credits: Some electric cars are eligible for federal and state tax credits, which can make them more affordable. If you lease an electric car, you may not be able to take advantage of these credits, as they typically go to the owner of the car.Ultimately, the decision to lease or buy an electric car depends on your personal financial situation and your long-term plans for the car. It may be helpful to compare the total cost of ownership for both options to see which one is the better fit for you."]},

{"question":"Won an incentive trip in 2013, left employer in 2014, received an earning statement with no cash but a huge tangible bonus listed","human_answers":["I had experience working for a company that manufactures stuff and giving products to the employees.

But they were straight-forward about it and I signed a paper acknowledging it. However, in your case you didn't get a product (that you could return when leaving if you didn't want to pay), but rather a service.

See my example above. Maybe it was buried somewhere in small letters. Can they do this a year after the trip was won and redeemed? As I said - in this case this sounds shady.

{"question":"Apartment Security Deposit refunds in Maryland","human_answers":["In Maryland, a landlord must hold your security deposit in an escrow account and pay you interest when returning the deposit.  The interest is simple interest; it does not compound. The interest rate that they must pay has changed over the last 43 years.  Before October 1, 2004, the rate was 4%.  Until January 1, 2015, the rate was 3%.  Currently, the rate is 1.5% OR the simple interest rate accrued at the daily U.S. Treasury yield curve rate for one year, as of the first business day of each year, whichever is greater.  (This year, the rate is 1.5%.)  Maryland's Department of Housing and Community Development has a Security Deposit Calculator for easy calculation of this interest; however, it only works for deposits since January 1, 2015. It is unclear to me whether the interest rate in effect is the one that was in place when the security deposit was made, or if the rate changes over the years.   At most, if you get 4% interest every year, I would expect you to receive $429.76, which is $158 + ($158 * 4% * 43).  The interest is accrued every 6 months, so you would not get any interest for the 3 months that you rented in your 44th year. (With the new law that took effect this year, interest is accrued monthly.) At least, if the interest rate changes with the new laws, I would expect you to receive $413.18, which is $158 + ($158 * 4% * 32.5) + ($158 * 3% * 10.25) + ($158 * 1.5% * 0.5).

Some of the key considerations include the company's stage of development, the amount of funding being sought, the industry in which the company operates, and the perceived risk associated with the investment.One common method for valuing a company before it goes public is to use a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, which estimates the present value of the company's future cash flows. This approach takes into account the company's expected growth rate, the level of risk associated with the investment, and the required rate of return for the investment.Another approach is to use a comparable company analysis, which compares the company being valued to similar companies that have gone public or have been acquired. This approach can help to provide insight into the potential value of the company based on the valuations of similar companies.It's important to note that valuing a company before it goes public can be challenging, as there is often a lack of reliable financial data and the company's future performance is uncertain.

{"question":"Can a company have a credit rating better than that of the country where it is located?","human_answers":["In one personal finance book I read that if a company is located in a country with credit rating X it can't have credit rating better (lower - i.e. further from AAA level) than X. This is simply wrong. Real world evidence proves it wrong. Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Exxon Mobile (XOM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Microsoft (MSFT) all have a triple-A rating today, even though the United States doesn't. Toyota (TM) remained triple-A for many years even after Japanese debt was downgraded. The explanation was the following: country has rating X because risk of doing business with it is X and so risk of doing business with any company located in that country automatically can't be better than X. When reading financial literature, you should always be critical. Let's evaluate this statement. First off, a credit rating is not the \"risk of doing business.\" That is way too generic. Specifically, a credit rating attempts to define an individual or company's ability to repay it's obligations. Buying treasuries constitutes as doing business with the gov't, but you can argue that buying stamps at USPS is also doing business with the gov't, and a credit rating won't affect the latter too much.  So a credit rating reflects the ability of an entity to repay it's obligations. What does the ability of a government to repay have to do with the ability of companies in that country to repay? Not much. Certainly, if a company keeps it's surplus cash all in treasuries, then downgrading the government will affect the company, but in general, the credit rating of a company determines the company's ability to pay."],"chatgpt_answers":["Yes, it is possible for a company to have a credit rating that is better than the credit rating of the country where it is located.

A credit rating is typically assigned by a credit rating agency, such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's, or Fitch Ratings.The creditworthiness of a company is generally based on its financial strength and stability, as well as its ability to generate revenue and profits. If a company has a strong financial profile, it may be assigned a higher credit rating than the country in which it is located. This can be due to a number of factors, including the company's ability to access capital markets, its diversified revenue streams, and its strong management team.On the other hand, if a country has a weaker economy or a less stable political environment, it may be assigned a lower credit rating than a company located within that country.

(USA\/Missouri)","human_answers":["I don't have a direct answer for you, but here are some other things you might consider to help you decide on a course of action in addition to Joe's note about consulting a CPA...  Get a couple contractors out to look the place over and give you some quotes on the work needed, most will do so for free, or a nominal fee.  Everything about the extent and cost of repairs is complete guess work until you have some firm numbers. You might also consider getting an up-to-date appraisal, particularly if you can find someone willing to give you an \"after improvements\" estimate as well.  The housing market has fluctuated a bunch in the last couple years, your current value may have shifted significantly from where you think it is if you haven't done one recently.  You will definitely have to pay for this service, I would estimate around $500 based on one I got in St Louis a few months ago.   You might also consider reaching out to a local property management company to find out where they think you would fall in the scope of the current rental market and what improvements they would recommend.  You will probably want to be onsite to talk to any of the above people about the work they are proposing, and your intended goals, so figure some travel costs and time into your evaluation. As one of your noted concerns was the state of the roof, I can tell you that in St Louis County, and the spec sheet for most shingle manufacturers, you are limited to two layers of shingles, then the roof is supposed to be stripped and redone from the bare wood.  Personally, I won't even do the second layer, I always go to bare wood and start over, if for no other reason than it gives me an opportunity to inspect the deck and deal with any minor problem areas before they become big problems. I don't know Greene County to know what the local code may be like, but odds are high that the shingle manufacture would not honor any warranty with this installation. Another potential gotcha that may be lurking out there is your ex may still have a lingering claim to the home if you go to sell it.  I don't know the rules in Missouri off hand, but where I grew up (with family in the real estate and title insurance businesses) there was a law regarding homestead rights.  If a spouse spent even one night in a property, they had an interest in it and an explicit waiver had to be signed to release said interest.  Review your divorce settlement and\/or contact your attorney to confirm your status in this regard. Also consider the potential of refinancing your mortgage to either reduce the payment, or get funds for the improvements\/repairs.   Final note, I understand wanting to help out a friend (I have done similar things more times than I can count), but seriously look at the situation and see if you can't get the rent or other compensation up to the level of the mortgage at least.   You mentioned that you have belongings still on the property, what would a storage unit for said items cost? In terms of juggling the numbers you could potentially use that value as justification to adjust the friends rent as a caretaker fee without any issue.  (Verify with your CPA) Talk to the friend and see if there are other parts of the job they would be willing and able to take on as consideration for the reduced rent (make sure you have at least a simple contract on any such agreement).   Or if none of the above are sufficient to balance the numbers, see if they would be willing to take on an actual room mate to help make up the difference."],"chatgpt_answers":["It can be beneficial to convert non-investment real estate to a rental property if you need to make major repairs, as long as the cost of the repairs is not too high in comparison to the expected rental income.

{"question":"I have a million dollars of disposable income. What should I do to best benefit the economy? ","human_answers":["At first, I thought this might be too broad.  There are of course thousands of things that you can do with your money to \"help the economy\".  But I think that there is room to discuss some broad strokes without trying to list a thousand details.   Regular investing (as you are now) helps the economy in that companies obtain money by selling their stock.  They can then use that money to fund expansion, etc.  These things can help the economy permanently.  Of course, they can also use the money to pay executive bonuses, which don't help the economy so much.   Similarly, just spending money does not normally help the economy.  Unless we are in a recession, it is mildly harmful to spend wastefully.  Money that could be going to support long term improvements in production instead is used to buy a luxury that doesn't terribly interest you.  I.e. if you don't want a bigger house or a more luxurious car don't buy it to \"stimulate\" the economy.   Many charitable donations have the same problem.  They help short term consumption somewhere.  And of course the charity starts asking you for more money.  Many charities waste most of a donation trying to get another one from the same person or family.   Sir John Maynard Keynes proposed that the best thing that people could do to help the economy is to invest in things that cause economic activity in turn.  He was mostly talking about things like roads, bridges, and dams that are out of the investing range of most people, so he wanted governments to do it, particularly during a recession.   So we are looking for ways to invest in durable improvements that will support economic activity in the future.  A million dollars is a small amount for many things, but there are some activities that work.  I'm going to list a few examples, but there are certainly others:   Fund microfinance.  Basically loan your million dollars to people who need a small amount of money.  These programs often allow you to determine the initial recipient and then that person determines the next recipient.  A million dollars can finance hundreds if not thousands of these loans.  They may be in the United States or in a developing country.   Set up a scholarship.  My recommendation would be to find an existing scholarship with a few recipients and ask them to add one a year for the million dollars.  A million dollars should typically produce about a scholarship a year in returns after inflation.  Of course, that's just regular inflation.  Education inflation is higher.   Solar prize.  Fund a program that gives out one solar installation every year or five to a family that owns a house, is struggling to pay utilities, and makes a compelling case.  Basically, whenever the investment grows enough to support it, make a new prize.   Buy something that will help other people make money.   This is just six ideas off the top of my head.  The goal here is to create something lasting that will promote economic activity.  So a program that loans money forward.  Or a scholarship or free textbook, particularly in a STEM field.  A small piece of infrastructure that helps people move around to work or spend their money.  Solar is a bit of a stretch here, but it can be justified if you believe that an investment now is an investment in moving towards the future.   The key thing here is to make your money do double duty.  By spending your money during a recession or investing during the rest of the business cycle, you can get some value for your money.  But even better is if that spending has a societal return as well.  Microfinance, scholarships, and infrastructure do that.  There is the immediate spending, plus there is the effect of the spending.  A business is established.  A mind is trained and working at a high income job.  People can move, work, and spend their own money."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are many ways you can use your disposable income to benefit the economy.

{"question":"Evidence For\/Against Real Estate Investing Vis-a-vis Investing in ETFs","human_answers":["Real Estate potentially has two components of profit, the increase in value, and the ongoing returns, similar to a stock appreciating and its dividends.   It's possible to buy both badly, and in the case of stocks, there are studies that show the typical investor lags the market by many percent.  Real estate is not a homogeneous asset class. A $200K house renting for $1,000 is a far different investment than a $100K 3 family renting for $2,000 total rents. Both exist depending on the part of the country you are in.  If you simply divide the price to the rent you get either 16.7X or 4.2X. This is an oversimplification, and of course, interest rates will push these numbers in one direction or another. It's safe to say that at any given time, the ratio can help determine if home prices are too high, a bargain, or somewhere in between.  As one article suggests, the median price tracks inflation pretty closely. And I'd add, that median home prices would track median income long term.  To circle back, yes, real estate can be a good investment if you buy right, find good tenants, and are willing to put in the time.  Note: Buying to rent and buying to live in are not always the same economic decision. The home buyer will very often buy a larger house than they should, and turn their own 'profit' into a loss. e.g. A buyer who would otherwise be advised to buy the $150K house instead of renting is talked into a bigger house by the real estate agent, the bank, the spouse. The extra cost of the $225K house is the 1\/3 more cost of repair, utilities, interest, etc. It's identical to needing a 1000 sq ft apartment, but grabbing one that's 1500 sq ft for the view."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several factors to consider when deciding whether to invest in real estate or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

But if you are worried about fluctuations then you could slowly rebalance into your final position by taking a couple of intermediary steps.

{"question":"What is a stock warrant? How do warrants work?","human_answers":["In Australia there are 2 type of warrants (I don't know if it is the same in the US, UK and other countries), the first are trading warrants and the second are instalment warrants. The trading warrants are exactly what it says, they are used for trading. They are similar to option and have calls and puts. As Cameron says, they differ from exchange traded options in that they are issued by the financial companies whereas options are generally written by other investors. Instalment warrants on the other hand are usually bought and sold by investors with a longer term view. There are no calls and puts and you can just go long with them. They are also issued by financial companies, and how they work is best explained through an example: if I was to buy a stock directly say I would be paying $50 per share, however an instalment warrant in the underlying stock may be offered for $27 per warrant. I could buy the warrant directly from the company when it is issued or on the secondary market just like shares. I would pay the $27 per warrant upfront, and then in 2 years time when the warrant expires I have the choice to purchase the underlying stock for the strike price of say $28, roll over to a new issue of warrants, sell it back on the secondary market, or let it expire, in which case I would receive any intrinsic value left in the warrant. You would have noticed that the warrant purchase price plus the strike price adds up to more than the share price ($55 compared to $50). This is the interest component inherent in the warrant which covers the borrowing costs until expiry, when you pay the second portion (the strike price) and receive the underlying shares. Another difference between Instalment warrants and trading warrants (and options) is that with instalment warrants you still get the full dividends just like the shares, but at a higher yield than the shares."],"chatgpt_answers":["A stock warrant is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a specified number of shares of stock at a fixed price, called the exercise price, at or within a certain time period. Warrants are typically issued by a company as a form of financing or as a means of providing additional compensation to employees.How warrants work:Issuance: A company issues warrants as a way to raise capital or as part of an employee compensation package. The warrants will specify the number of shares that can be purchased, the exercise price, and the expiration date.Exercise: The holder of a warrant can exercise their right to purchase the underlying stock at any time before the expiration date as long as the stock is trading above the exercise price. To exercise the warrant, the holder must pay the exercise price plus any applicable fees.Expiration: If the holder does not exercise the warrant before the expiration date, the warrant becomes void and the holder no longer has the right to purchase the underlying stock.Warrants are similar to options, but they tend to have longer expiration periods and are usually issued by the company rather than traded on an exchange. Because warrants give the holder the right to purchase stock at a fixed price in the future, they can be an attractive investment for those who believe the stock price will increase over time. However, like all investments, warrants carry some level of risk and it is important to carefully consider the terms and conditions before deciding to invest."]},

{"question":"Can I rollover an \u201cindividual retirement annuity\u201d to an IRA?","human_answers":["Annuities, like life insurance, are sold rather than bought.  Once upon a time, IRAs inherited from a non-spouse  required the beneficiary to  (a) take all the money out within 5 years, or  (b) choose to receive the value of the IRA at the time of  the IRA owner's death in equal installments over the expected  lifetime of the beneficiary.  If the latter option was chosen, the IRA custodian issued the  fixed-term annuity in return for the IRA assets. If the IRA  was invested in (say) 15000 shares of IBM stock, that stock  would then belong to the IRA custodian who was obligated to  pay $x per year to the beneficiary for the next 23 years (say). There was no investment any more that could be transferred  to another broker, or be sold and the proceeds invested in Facebook stock (say).  Nor was the custodian under any  obligation to do anything except pay $x per year to the  beneficiary for the 23 years. Financial planners loved to get at this money under the old IRA rules by suggesting that if all the IRA money were taken out and invested in stocks or mutual funds through  their company, the company would pay a guaranteed $y  per year, would pay more than $y in each year that the  investments did well, would continue payment until the  beneficiary died (or till the death of the beneficiary  or beneficiary's spouse - whoever died later), and would return the entire sum invested (less payouts already made, of course) in case of premature death. $y typically would be a little larger than $x too, because it factored in some earnings of the investment over the years.

{"question":"Comparing ETFs following the same index","human_answers":["The key two things to consider when looking at similar\/identical ETFs is the typical (or 'indicative') spread, and the trading volume and size of the ETF.

This is a huge drain if you make a lot of transactions and can easily be a much larger concern than a relatively trivial difference in ongoing charges depending on your exact expected trading frequency. Poor spreads are also generally related to a lack of liquidity, and illiquid assets are usually the first to become heavily disconnected from the underlying in cases where the authorized participants (APs) face issues. In general with stock ETFs that trade very liquid markets this has historically not been much of an issue, as the creation\/redemption mechanism on these types of assets is pretty robust: it's consequences on typical spread is much more important for the average retail investor.

However, there can still be some differences between ETFs tracking the same index. These differences can include:Expense ratios: The expense ratio is the annual fee that an ETF charges to its investors. It is expressed as a percentage of the fund's assets and is taken out of the fund's returns. ETFs tracking the same index may have different expense ratios, so it's important to compare the fees of different ETFs to find the most cost-effective option.Trading volume: ETFs with higher trading volume tend to have more liquidity, which means it is easier to buy and sell shares of the ETF. This can be important for investors who may need to sell their ETF shares quickly or in large quantities.Bid-ask spreads: The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for an ETF and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. ETFs with narrow bid-ask spreads tend to have lower trading costs because it costs less to buy or sell shares of the ETF.Tracking error: Tracking error measures how closely an ETF follows the performance of its underlying index. ETFs with lower tracking error are generally considered to be more effective at replicating the performance of the index.It's important to consider these factors when comparing ETFs following the same index.

{"question":"Tracking my spending, and incoming and outgoing (i.e cashflow)","human_answers":["Honing in on your last question: Is there a better way?  I think there is, but it would require you to change the way you handle your spending, and that may not be of interest to you.  Right now you have a lot of manual work, keeping track of expenditures and then entering the, every day. The great thing about switching to a habit where you pay for everything using a debit or credit card is that you can skip the manual entry by importing your transactions from your bank. You mention that your bank doesn't allow for exporting. There's still a chance that your bank can connect with a solution like Wave Accounting (http:\/\/www.waveaccouting.com), which is free and made for small business accounting. (Full disclosure: I represent Wave.) If your current bank doesn't permit export or connections with Wave, it may be worth switching to a different bank. It's a bit of a pain to make the switch, I know, but you really will save a massive amount of time and effort over the course of the year, as well as minimize the risk of human error, compared to entering your receipts on a daily basis. In Wave, you can still enter all of your cash receipts manually if you want to continue with your current practice of cash payments. One important thing to mention, too: If you're looking for a better way of doing things, make sure it includes proper backup. There would be nothing worse than entering all that data onto a spreadsheet and then something happening to your computer and you lose it all.  Wave Accounting is backed up hourly and uses bank-level security to keep your information safe. One last thing: as I mention above, Wave Accounting is free.

{"question":"Do company-provided meals need to be claimed on my taxes?","human_answers":["In many cases yes.  In the case of an employer handing employees a credit card to use, that is clearly income if the card is used for something other than a business expense. Generally speaking, if you're receiving something with a significant value without strings attached, it is likely taxable. Google no doubt has an army of tax attorneys, so perhaps they are able to exploit loopholes of some sort."],"chatgpt_answers":["In general, if you receive a benefit from your employer, such as a company-provided meal, you may need to include the value of that benefit in your taxable income. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the value of meals provided by an employer is generally taxable if the meals are furnished for the convenience of the employer. This means that if the employer provides meals to you because it is more convenient for the company for you to eat at the workplace, rather than going out to eat, the value of those meals may be taxable.On the other hand, if the employer provides meals to you as a de minimis benefit, the value of those meals is not taxable. A de minimis benefit is a minor benefit that is infrequent or unusual, and the value of which is minimal. For example, if your employer provides you with an occasional meal during a business trip, the value of that meal may be considered a de minimis benefit and not taxable.If you receive company-provided meals and are not sure whether they are taxable, you should check with your employer or consult a tax professional for more information.

{"question":"Please explain: What exactly is a CDS or \u201cCredit Default Swap\u201d?","human_answers":["A Credit Default Swap is a derivative, a financial contract with a value dependent upon another asset. A CDS, in essence, is exactly what it sounds like a swap upon default. The typical arrangement is that a holder of non-risk free credit enters into an arrangement with a counterparty to pay the counterparty a portion of the income received from the non-risk free credit in exchange for being able to force the counterparty to deliver risk free credit if the non-risk free credit defaults. Banks use this mechanism to reduce the risk of the loans they produce while packaging them to be resold to investors.  Banks will typically buy CDSes on mortgages and corporate bonds, paying part of the income from interest payments received, to have the right to force counterparties, typically hedge funds and insurance companies, to swap national Treasuries upon the event that the mortgages or corporates default.  The banks receive less income yet are able to take on more inventory to sell to investors so that more loans can be made to borrowers, households and corporations. Hedge funds typically take on more complex arrangements while insurance companies sell CDSes because they are usually overflowing with risk-free assets yet are starved for income."],"chatgpt_answers":["A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial derivative contract in which one party (the buyer or \"protection seller\") agrees to make periodic payments to the other party (the seller or \"protection buyer\") in exchange for protection against the risk of default on a specified debt obligation, known as the \"reference obligation.\" The reference obligation can be a bond, a loan, or other type of debt instrument.Here's how a CDS works:The protection buyer (also known as the \"investor\") pays the protection seller (also known as the \"issuer\") a periodic fee, known as the \"spread,\" in exchange for protection against the risk of default on the reference obligation.If the reference obligation defaults (e.g., the borrower misses a payment), the protection buyer can make a claim to the protection seller for the loss suffered as a result of the default.The protection seller is required to compensate the protection buyer for the loss, up to the full amount of the reference obligation.CDS contracts are typically used to transfer the credit risk of a debt obligation from one party to another, allowing the parties to manage their exposure to credit risk more effectively. They are also used by investors as a way to speculate on the creditworthiness of a particular issuer or the overall credit market.It's important to note that CDS contracts are not insurance policies and are not regulated as such. They are subject to the general rules and regulations governing financial derivatives, which can vary by jurisdiction."]},

{"question":"What is a bull put spread?","human_answers":["Bull means the investor is betting on a rising market. Puts are a type of stock option where the seller of a put option promises to buy 100 shares of stock from the buyer of the put option at a pre-agreed price called the strike price on any day before expiration day.  The buyer of the put option does not have to sell (it is optional, thats why it is called buying an option).  However, the seller of the put is required to make good on their promise to the buyer. The broker can require the seller of the put option to have a deposit, called margin, to help make sure that they can make good on the promise.   Profit... The buyer can profit from the put option if the stock price moves down substantially.   The buyer of the put option does not need to own the stock, he can sell the option to someone else.  If the buyer of the put option also owns the stock, the put option can be thought of like an insurance policy on the value of the stock.  The seller of the put option profits if the stock price stays the same or rises.  Basically, the seller comes out best if they can sell put options that no one ends up using by expiration day. A spread is an investment consisting of buying one option and selling another. Let's put bull and put and spread together with an example from Apple. So, if you believed Apple Inc. AAPL (currently 595.32) was going up or staying the same through JAN you could sell the 600 JAN put and buy the 550 put.  If the price rises beyond 600, your profit would be the difference in price of the puts.  Let's explore this a little deeper (prices from google finance 31 Oct 2012): Worst Case:  AAPL drops below 550.  The bull put spread investor owes (600-550)x100 shares = $5000 in JAN but received $2,035 for taking this risk. EDIT 2016: The \"worst case\" was the outcome in this example, the AAPL stock price on options expiry Jan 18, 2013 was about $500\/share. Net profit = $2,035 - $5,000 = -$2965 = LOSS of $2965 Best Case:  AAPL stays above 600 on expiration day in JAN. Net Profit = $2,035 - 0 = $2035 Break Even:  If AAPL drops to 579.65, the value of the 600 JAN AAPL put sold will equal the $2,035 collected and the bull put spread investor will break even. Commissions have been ignored in this example."],"chatgpt_answers":["A bull put spread is a bullish options trading strategy that involves purchasing a put option with a lower strike price and selling a put option with a higher strike price on the same underlying security. The strategy is called a \"bull\" spread because it is a bullish strategy, meaning that it is based on the assumption that the underlying security will increase in price.The trader who uses a bull put spread hopes to profit from the difference between the two put options, with the goal being to make a profit if the underlying security increases in price. If the underlying security does increase in price, the value of the put option with the lower strike price will decrease, while the value of the put option with the higher strike price will increase. As a result, the trader can potentially make a profit by selling the put option with the higher strike price for more than the cost of purchasing the put option with the lower strike price.It's important to note that a bull put spread is a limited risk strategy, as the maximum loss is the difference between the strike prices of the two put options minus the premium received from selling the put option with the higher strike price. This means that the trader's potential loss is limited to the amount of money that they paid for the put option with the lower strike price.","A bull put spread is a bullish options trading strategy that involves buying a put option with a lower strike price and selling a put option with a higher strike price on the same underlying asset. The put options are both purchased at the same time, and the strategy is designed to profit if the underlying asset increases in price.Here's an example of how a bull put spread might work:You buy a put option with a strike price of $50 for $2 per share.You sell a put option with a strike price of $55 for $1 per share.The cost of the bull put spread is the difference between the two options, or $1 per share.If the underlying asset increases in price, the value of both the bought and sold put options will decrease. The profit from the trade is the difference between the initial cost of the spread and the decrease in the value of the options. For example, if the underlying asset increases to $60 per share, the value of the bought put option with a strike price of $50 might decrease to $0.50 per share, while the value of the sold put option with a strike price of $55 might decrease to $0. The profit from the trade would be $0.50 - $1.00 = -$0.50 per share.Bull put spreads can be used as a way to generate income while also potentially benefiting from an increase in the price of the underlying asset. However, it's important to understand that the potential profit from a bull put spread is limited to the difference between the strike prices of the two options, minus the cost of the spread.

Many countries have banned or heavily restricted the sale of binary options to retail investors, citing concerns about high levels of fraud and the lack of investor protection.It is important to be aware of the risks involved in trading binary options and to only trade with money that you can afford to lose.

{"question":"Got charged ridiculous amount for doctor's walk in visit. What are my options?","human_answers":["You will often receive a lower bill if you simply wait for a second or third billing statement. I was once given the advice to never pay a medical bill until after they had sent three notices, because they will almost certainly reduce the amount due. Sounds crazy, right? I have excellent credit, so the idea of risking it by ignoring bills disturbed me greatly, and I scoffed at the advice.  I then had a similar experience to you, and decided to take the advice. By the third statement, the bill was reduced to less than half of the original, with zero intervention on my part. I then paid it without any impact to my credit whatsoever. I've since done that every time I receive healthcare services, and the bill is always reduced on subsequent statements, generally to less than half of the original bill. Sometimes it's because insurance finally got around to paying. Sometimes a credit is mysteriously added. Sometimes line items disappear without explanation. (Line items sometimes appear over time, too, but the overall balance generally goes down.) I don't know the reason for it, but it works. This has happened with a variety of providers, so it's not just one company that does it. Granted, I never called to negotiate the price, so I can't say if I would've gotten a better deal by doing that. I like it because it requires no time or effort on my part, and it has greatly reduced my medical bills with zero impact to my credit. I only have personal anecdotes to back it up, but it's worked for me."],"chatgpt_answers":["I'm sorry to hear that you were charged a high amount for a doctor's visit. There are a few options you can consider in this situation:Try to negotiate the bill with the doctor's office: It's possible that the high charge was a mistake or that the office may be willing to reduce the bill if you explain your financial situation. You can try calling the office and explaining the situation, and see if they are willing to work with you on the cost.Check if you have insurance coverage: If you have health insurance, it's worth checking to see if the visit was covered under your plan. You may be able to get some or all of the charges reimbursed if the visit was considered medically necessary.Consider alternative payment options: If the cost of the visit is still too high, you may be able to set up a payment plan or explore other options such as financing through a medical credit card.Look into financial assistance programs: There may be local or national programs that can help cover the cost of medical bills if you are unable to pay. These programs can vary by location, so it's worth doing some research to see if any are available in your area.It's important to keep in mind that each situation is unique, and the best course of action will depend on your specific circumstances. If you are unsure about what to do, you may want to consider consulting with a healthcare advocate or financial advisor for additional guidance."]},

{"question":"If I buy a share from myself at a higher price, will that drive the price up so I can sell all my shares the higher price?","human_answers":["The market maker will always compare the highest bid and the lowest ask. A trade will happen if the highest bid is at least as high as the lowest ask.

Adding a bid for one share (or a million shares) at a higher bid price will trigger a sale. If you bid $210 for one share, you will pay $210 for one of the shares that were offered at $200. If you have $210 million in cash and add a bid for 1,000,000 AAPL at $210, you will pay $210 for all shares with an ask of $200.00, then $200.01, then $200.02 until you either bought all shares with an ask up to $210, or until you bought a million shares.  With AAPL, you probably bid the price up to $201 with a million shares, so you made lots of people very happy while losing about 10 million dollars. So let's say this is a much smaller company.  You have driven the share price up to $210, but there is nobody else bidding above $200. So nobody is going to buy your shares. Until some people think there is something going on and enter higher bids, but then some people will take advantage of this and ask lower than your $210. And there will be more people trying to make cash by selling their shares at a good price than people tricked into bidding over $200, so it is most likely that you lose out.

They do not offer chargeback protection because they are not reversible.Cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are digital currencies that are decentralized and not regulated by any government or financial institution. Transactions with cryptocurrencies do not offer chargeback protection because they are not reversible.It's important to note that while these payment options may not offer chargeback protection, they may still provide some level of security and fraud protection. For example, cash is generally considered a secure payment method because it is not linked to any personal or financial information.

{"question":"Should a retail trader choose a broker with access to dark pools","human_answers":["That's like a car dealer advertising their \"huge access\" to Chevrolet.  All brokers utilize dark pools nowadays, either their own or one belonging to a larger financial institution.  Why?  Because that's a primary source of broker income.  Example: Under current US regulations the broker is under no obligation to pass these orders to actual (a.k.a. lit) exchanges.  Instead it can internalize them in its dark pool as long as it \"improves the price\".  So: If a broker doesn't run its own dark pool, then it sends the orders to the dark pool run by a larger institution (JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Getco, Knight Capital) and gets some fraction of the dark pool's profit in return. Are Mom and Pop negatively impacted by this?  Not for most order types.  They each even got a free penny out of the deal!  But if there were no dark pools, that $1.00 difference between their trade prices would have gone half ($0.50) to Mom's counterparty and half ($0.50) to Pop's counterparty, who could be someone else's Mom and someone else's Pop. So ... that's why brokers all use dark pools, and why their advertisement of their dark pool access is silly.  They're basically saying, \"We're going to occasionally throw you a free penny while making 49 times that much from you\"! (Note: Now apply the above math to a less liquid product than AAPL.  Say, where the spread is not $0.01, but more like $0.05.  Now Mom and Pop still might make a penny each, while the broker can make $4.98 on a 100 share trade!)"],"chatgpt_answers":["It is not necessarily a requirement for a retail trader to choose a broker with access to dark pools. Dark pools are private exchanges or forums that allow traders to buy and sell large blocks of securities anonymously, without the prices being visible to the rest of the market. Dark pools are often used by institutional traders and may not be relevant or useful for individual retail traders.There are other factors that retail traders should consider when choosing a broker, such as the broker's fees, trade execution speed, the range of available assets, and the overall reliability and security of the broker's platform. Retail traders should also consider whether the broker is regulated by a reputable financial authority and whether it offers the types of trading tools and resources that meet their needs.Ultimately, the decision of whether to choose a broker with access to dark pools will depend on the individual trader's goals and needs. It is important for retail traders to do their due diligence and carefully research and compare different brokers before making a decision.","Dark pools are private exchanges or platforms that allow traders to buy and sell securities outside of traditional stock exchanges.

For example, it may allow the company to issue new shares as needed, rather than having to go through the process of seeking shareholder approval each time it wants to raise funds.To facilitate acquisitions: A company may increase the number of authorized shares to have more shares available to issue as part of an acquisition. This can be a more attractive option for the acquiring company, as it may be able to issue stock rather than cash to pay for the acquisition.To make it easier to issue stock-based compensation: Companies may increase the number of authorized shares to have more available to issue as part of employee compensation plans, such as stock options or restricted stock units.Ultimately, the decision to vote for or against an increase in the number of authorized shares will depend on the specific circumstances of the company and the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a move."]},

LLCs are taxed as a partnership by default, but they can also elect to be taxed as a corporation.If an LLC is taxed as a partnership, the profits and losses of the business are passed through to the individual members of the LLC and are reported on their personal income tax returns. This means that the LLC does not pay taxes on its income at the corporate level; instead, the profits and losses are allocated to the members based on their ownership interests in the LLC and are taxed at the individual level.For example, if an LLC has a net loss for the year, each member of the LLC can claim their allocated share of the loss on their personal income tax return.

{"question":"How much is inflation?","human_answers":["Nobel laureate economist, Paul Krugman, wrote a piece many moons ago about economic expansion and money supply.  As an illustration of how money supply affects the economy, he used the example of a baby-sitting co-op.  While simplistic, it provides an easy to grasp notion of how printing money and restricting it (e.g. by pegging the currency to gold reserves) can affect the economy. Here is an excerpt from his webpage ( http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/krugman\/www\/howfast.html ): \"With the decline of the traditional extended family, in which relatives were available to take care of children at need, many parents in the United States have sought alternative arrangements. A popular scheme is the baby-sitting coop, in which a group of parents agree to help each other out on a reciprocal basis, with each parent serving both as baby-sitter and baby-sittee. Any such coop requires rules that ensure that all members do their fair share. One natural answer, at least to people accustomed to a market economy, is to use some kind of token or marker system: parents \"earn\" tokens by babysitting, then in turn hand over these tokens when their own children are minded by others. For example, a recently formed coop in Western Massachusetts uses Popsicle sticks, each representing one hour of babysitting. When a new parent enters the coop, he or she receives an initial allocation of ten sticks.  This system is self-regulating, in the sense that it automatically ensures that over any length of time a parent will put in more or less the same amount of time that he or she receives. It turns out, however, that establishing such a token system is not enough to make a coop work properly. It is also necessary to get the number of tokens per member more or less right. To see why, suppose that there were very few tokens in circulation. Parents will want on average to hold some reserve of tokens - enough to deal with the possibility that they may want to go out a few times before they have a chance to babysit themselves and earn more tokens. Any individual parent can, of course, try to accumulate more tokens by babysitting more and going out less. But what happens if almost everyone is trying to accumulate tokens - as they will be if there are very few in circulation? One parent's decision to go out is another's opportunity to babysit. So if everyone in the coop is trying to add to his or her reserve of tokens, there will be very few opportunities to babysit. This in turn will make people even more reluctant to go out, and use up their precious token reserves; and the level of activity in the coop may decline to a disappointingly low level.  The solution to this problem is, of course, simply to issue more Popsicle sticks. But not too many - because an excess of popsicle sticks can pose an equally severe problem. Suppose that almost everyone in the coop has more sticks than they need; then they will be eager to go out, but reluctant to babysit. It will therefore become hard to find babysitters - and since opportunities to use popsicle sticks will become rare, people will become even less willing to spend time and effort earning them. Too many tokens in circulation, then, can be just as destructive as too few.\" -- Paul Krugman, 1997 (accessed webpage 2010)."],"chatgpt_answers":["Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, subsequently, purchasing power is falling.

You are looking to buy a property to live in - so how long do you intend to live in and hold the property? I would assume at least for the medium to long term. If this is your intention then why are you getting cold feet? What you should be concerned about is that you do not overstretch on your borrowings! Make sure you allow a buffer of 2% to 3% above current interest rates so that if rates do go up you can still afford the repayments. And if you get a fixed rate - then you should allow the buffer in case variable rates are higher when your fixed period is over. Regarding the doomsayers telling you that property prices are going to crash - well they were saying that in 2008, then again in 2010, then again in 2012. I don't know about you but I have seen no crash. Sure when interest rates have gone up property prices have levelled off and maybe gone down by 10% to 15% in some areas, but as soon as interest rates start falling again property prices start increasing again. It's all part of the property cycle.  I actually find it is a better time to buy when interest rates are higher and you can negotiate a better bargain and lower price. Then when interest rates start falling you benefit from lower repayments and increasing property prices. The only way there will be a property crash in Australia is if there was a dramatic economic downturn and unemployment rates rose to 10% or higher. But with good economic conditions, an increasing population and low supplies of newly build housing in Australia, I see no dramatic crashes in the foreseeable future. Yes we may get periods of weakness when interest rates increase, with falls up to 15% in some areas, but no crash of 40% plus. As I said above, these periods of weakness actually provide opportunities to buy properties at a bit of a discount. EDIT In your comments you say you intend to buy with a monthly mortgage repayment of $2500 in place of your current monthly rent of $1800. That means your loan amount would be somewhere around $550k to $600K. You also mention you would be taking on a 5 year fixed rate, and look to sell in about 2 years time if you can break even (I assume that is break even on the price you bought at). In 2 years you would have paid $16,800 more on your mortgage than you would have in rent. So here are the facts: A better strategy:"],"chatgpt_answers":["It is generally not accurate to say that a falling dollar means doom for real estate. The value of real estate can be influenced by many factors, including local economic conditions, supply and demand for housing, and overall market trends. A falling dollar may have some impact on real estate values, but it is just one of many factors that can affect the market.It is important to note that the value of the dollar, like the value of any currency, is determined by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, interest rates, and the perceived stability of the government issuing the currency.

This can reduce your overall tax burden and potentially save you money.Emergency funds: It is important to have an emergency fund in case of unexpected expenses or a loss of income. Paying off student debt quickly may leave you with less financial flexibility if an emergency arises.Opportunities for career advancement: Paying off student debt quickly may require you to take on additional work or sacrifice other opportunities, such as training or professional development.

There is mention on the site of no-transaction-fee funds (NTF), but I wasn't able to find a list of such funds.  Again, you might have to ask. Vanguard also offers some non-Vanguard funds without transaction fees.  If you go the Vanguard page on other mutual funds you can use the dropdown on the right to select other fund companies.

TIAA-CREF is another option, as is Fideltiy (which you didn't mention), and innumerable others.  Realistically, though, you probably don't need a gigantic lineup of funds.  If you're juggling money between more than a handful of funds, your investment scheme is probably needlessly complex.

{"question":"How can I determine if a debt consolidation offer is real or a scam?","human_answers":["I think in such situations a good rule of thumb may be - if you are asked to pay significant sums of money upfront before anything is done, stop and ask yourself, what would you do if they don't do what they promised? They know who you are, but usually most you know is a company name and phone number. Both can disappear in a minute and what are you left with?  If they said they'd pay off the debt and issue the new loan - fine, let them do it and then you pay them. If they insist on having money upfront without delivering anything - unless it's a very big and known and established company you probably better off not doing it. Either it's a scam or in the minuscule chance they are legit you still risking too much - you're giving money and not getting anything in return."],"chatgpt_answers":["Debt consolidation can be a legitimate way to manage debt, but it's important to be cautious and do your research before committing to any offer. Here are some tips to help you determine if a debt consolidation offer is real or a scam:Research the company: Start by doing some research on the company offering the debt consolidation service. Look for reviews and testimonials from past customers, and check to see if the company is licensed and accredited.Be wary of upfront fees: Legitimate debt consolidation companies generally do not charge upfront fees. If a company is asking for an upfront fee, it could be a red flag that they are a scam.Understand the terms and conditions: Make sure you fully understand the terms and conditions of the debt consolidation offer. Be wary of offers that seem too good to be true or have hidden fees.Avoid companies that promise to \"erase\" your debt: No company can legally erase your debt. If a company promises to do so, it is likely a scam.Consider other options: If you're not sure about a debt consolidation offer, consider seeking advice from a non-profit credit counseling agency or financial advisor. They can help you explore other options for managing your debt.Remember, it's important to be cautious and do your research before committing to any debt consolidation offer.

If they pay to you personally (1099) - it goes on your Schedule C, and you pay SE taxes on it. If they pay to your corporation, the corporation will pay it to you as salary, and will pay payroll taxes on it.

{"question":"How should my brother and I structure our real estate purchase?","human_answers":["We\u2019re buying the home right over $200,000 so that means he will only need to put down (as a \u2018gift\u2019) roughly $7000. I'm with the others, don't call this a gift unless it is a gift.   I'd have him check with the bank that previously refused him a mortgage if putting both of you on a mortgage would allay their concerns.  Your cash flow would be paying the mortgage payment and if you failed to do so, then they could fall back on his.  That may make more sense to them, even if they would deny each of you a loan on your own.  This works for them because either of you is responsible for the whole loan.  It works for him because he was already willing to be responsible for the whole loan.  And your alternative plan makes you responsible for the whole loan, so this is just as good for you.   At what percentage would you suggest splitting ownership and future expenses? Typically a cash\/financing partnership would be 50\/50, but since it\u2019s only a 3.5% down-payment instead of 20% is that still fair? Surprisingly enough, a 3.5% down-payment that accumulates is about half the equity of a 20% down-payment.  So your suggestion of a 25%-75% split makes sense if 20% would give a 50%-50% split.   I expected it to be considerably lower.  The way that I calculated it was to have his share increase by his equity share of the \"rent\" which I set to the principal plus interest payment for a thirty year loan.  With a 20% down-payment, this would give him 84% equity.  With 3.5%, about 40% equity.  I'm not sure why 84% equity should be the equivalent of a 50% share, but it may be a side effect of other expenses.  Perhaps taking property taxes out would reduce the equity share.   Note that if you increase the down-payment to 20%, your mortgage payment will drop substantially.  The difference in interest between 3.5% and 20% equity is a couple hundred dollars.  Also, you'll be able to eliminate any PMI payment at 20%.   It could be argued that if he pays a third of the monthly mortgage payment, that that would give him the same 50% equity stake on a 3.5% down-payment as he would get with a 20% down-payment.  The problem there is that then he is effectively subsidizing your monthly payment.  If he were to stop doing that for some reason, you'd have what is effectively a 50% increase in your rent.  It would be safer for you to handle the monthly payment while he handles the down-payment.   If you couldn't pay the mortgage, it sounds like he is in a position to buy out your equity, rent the property, and take over the mortgage payment.  If he stopped being able to pay his third of the mortgage, it's not evident that you'd be able to pick up the slack from him much less buy him out.  And it's unlikely that you'd find someone else willing to replace him under those terms.  But your brother could construct things such that in the face of tragedy, you'd inherit his equity in the house.  If you're making the entire mortgage payment, that's a stable situation.   He's not at risk because he could take over the mortgage if necessary.  You're not at risk because you inherit his equity share and can afford the monthly payment.  So even in the face of tragedy, things can go on.  And that's important, as otherwise you could lose your equity in the house."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several options for structuring a real estate purchase with a brother or any other family member or friend. Some common options include:Joint Tenancy: In a joint tenancy, both parties own the property equally and have the right of survivorship, which means that if one party dies, the other party automatically inherits their share of the property. This can be a good option if you want to keep things simple and want to ensure that the property will pass to the surviving owner automatically.Tenancy in Common: In a tenancy in common, each party owns a specific share of the property (e.g., 50\/50), and each party has the right to sell or transfer their share to someone else at any time. This can be a good option if you want to have more control over what happens to your share of the property.Limited Liability Company (LLC): Another option is to set up an LLC to hold the property. This can provide some legal protection for the owners and can make it easier to manage the property and any future decisions about it.It's important to consider the tax implications of each option and to consult with a lawyer or financial advisor to determine the best approach for your specific situation."]},
{"question":"If an index goes up because an underlying company issues more shares, what happens to the ETF","human_answers":["If a stock that makes up a big part of the Dow Jones Industrial   Average decided to issue a huge number of additional shares, that will   make the index go up. At least this is what should happen, since an   index is basically a sum of the market cap of the contributing   companies. No, indices can have various weightings. The DJIA is a price-weighted index not market-cap weighted. An alternative weighting besides market-cap and price is equal weighting. From Dow Jones: Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2122. Introduced in May 1896, the index, also   referred to as The Dow\u00ae, is a price-weighted measure of 30 U.S.   blue-chip companies. Thus, I can wonder what in the new shares makes the index go up? If a stock is split, the Dow divisor is adjusted as one could easily see how the current Dow value isn't equal to the sum or the share prices of the members of the index. In other cases, there may be a dilution of earnings but that doesn't necessarily affect the stock price directly as there may be options exercised or secondary offerings made. SO if the index, goes up, will the ETF DIA also go up automatically   although no additional buying has happened in the ETF itself? If the index rises and the ETF doesn't proportionally, then there is an arbitrage opportunity for someone to buy the DIA shares that can be redeemed for the underlying stocks that are worth more in this case. Look at the Creation and Redemption Unit process that exists for ETFs."],"chatgpt_answers":["If a company that is part of an index issues more shares, it could potentially affect the value of the index and, in turn, the value of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the index.

However, if the demand for the company's shares is strong, the value of the shares could increase, which could offset the dilutive effect on the index and potentially even cause the value of the ETF to rise.It's important to note that the issuance of more shares by a company that is part of an index is just one of many factors that can affect the value of the index and the ETF that tracks it.

{"question":"Is there a measure that uses both cost of living plus income?","human_answers":["But what if I am getting paid salary from a source in India? In other words, it may be that in India a research assistant at a college on average earns a third of what a research assistant like me earns here in US. In that case, even if my cost of living there is much less, so is my salary. There are sites that provide a good guidance for what the average salary for an profession with x years of experience would be. Of course some would get paid more than average. So you can try and make a logic, if in US say you are being paid more than average, you would be paid more than average elsewhere. Plus If moving from Developed to Developing country, one has the Advantage of positive pedigree bias.  There are also websites that would give the Purchasing Power Parity for quite a few currency pairs. The Real difficulty to find is whether the Lifestyle you have in a specific country would be similar in other country. If you compare like for like it becomes slightly skewed. If you compare equivalence, then can you adjust.  A relevant example my friend in US had a Independent Bungalow in US. It was with Basement and attic, 2 levels of living space with 4 bedroom. He shifted to India and got a great salary compared to normal Indian salary. However this kind of house in India in Bangalore would be affordable only to CEO's of top companies. So is living in a 3 room apartment fine? There are multiple such aspects. Drinking a Starbucks coffee couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in US. In India this would be considered luxury. A like for equivalent comparison is \"One drinks 3-4 mugs of Coffee\" in US, and average Indian drinks \"Tea\/Coffee 3-4 mugs\". In India the local Tea \/ Coffee would be Rs 10 - Rs 20. A Starbucks would come with starting price of Rs 150. The same applies to food. A McBurger in India would be around Rs 100. The Indian equivalent Wada Pav is for Rs 10. A Sub Way would be Rs 150. A Equivalent Mumbai Sandwich around Rs 25. I personally am picky about food, so it doesn't matter where I go, I can only eat specific things, which means I spend a huge amount of money if I am outside of India. When I was in US, I couldn't afford a maid, driver or any help. In India I have 2 maids, a cooking maid and a driver. Plus I get plumber, electrician, window cleaner, and all the help without costing me much. Things that I absolutely can't dream in US. My colleague in UK preferred to stay in a specific locality as it has a very good Church. So if its important, one may find few good ones in India if one is Roman Catholic, if one follows Lutheran, Greek Orthodox, tough luck.  Citizenship: Does it matter ... A foreign national may never get an Indian citizenship. Children don't qualify either unless both parents are Indian. Health Care: Again is quite different. One may feel Health care in US is not good or very expensive ... but there are multiple aspects of this. So in essence its very broad there is traffic, cleanliness, climate, culture, etc ...

PPP is an economic theory that compares the purchasing power of different currencies in different countries by taking into account the cost of living in those countries. It allows for a comparison of living standards between countries by taking into account the differences in prices for goods and services.For example, if the cost of living is higher in one country compared to another, the purchasing power of the currency in the first country will be lower, even if the nominal exchange rate between the two currencies is the same. PPP helps to adjust for these differences in prices and allows for a more accurate comparison of living standards between countries.There are several measures of PPP, including the \"Big Mac Index,\" which compares the price of a Big Mac burger in different countries as a way to compare the purchasing power of different currencies.

{"question":"Why is the price of my investment only updated once per day?","human_answers":["There is no fundamental, good reason, I think; \"that's just how it's done\" (which is what all the other answers seem to be saying, w\/o coming out and admitting it). Just guessing, but I'll bet most of the reason is historical: Before up-to-the-moment quotes were readily available, that was a bit tedious to calculate\/update the fund's value, so enacted-laws let it be done just once per day.  (@NL7 quotes the security act of 1940, which certainly has been updated, but also still might contain the results of crufty rationales, like this.) There are genuinely different issues between funds and stocks, though: One share of a fund is fundamentally different from one share of stock: There is a finite supply of Company-X-stock, and people are trading that piece of ownership around, and barter to find an mutually-agreeable-price.  But when you buy into a mutual-fund, the mutual-fund \"suddenly has more shares\" -- it takes your money and uses it to buy shares of the underlying stocks (in a ratio equal to its current holdings).  As a consequence: the mutual fund's price isn't determined by two people bartering and agreeing on a price (like stock); there is exactly one sane way to price a mutual fund, and that's the weighted total of its underlying stock.  If you wanted to sell your ownership-of-Mutual-Fund-Z to a friend at 2:34pm, there wouldn't be any bartering, you'd just calculate the value based on the stated-value of the underlying stock at that exact moment. So: there's no inherent reason you can't instantaneously price a mutual fund.  BUT people don't really buy\/sell funds to each other -- they go to the fund-manager and essentially make a deposit-or-withdraw.  The fund-manager is only required by law to do it once a day (and perhaps even forbidden from doing it more often?), so that's all they do. [Disclaimer: I know very little about markets and finance. But I recognize answers that are 'just because'.]"],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several reasons why the price of an investment may only be updated once per day. One reason is that the market for the investment closes for a period of time each day, and the price is only updated when the market reopens. For example, stock markets typically close at 4:00pm Eastern Time and do not reopen until the next business day. During this time, the price of a stock will not change.Another reason why the price of an investment may only be updated once per day is because the investment is not traded on a continuous basis. Some investments, such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are priced at the end of the trading day based on the value of their underlying assets. The price of these investments is typically only updated once per day, after the market closes.It's also possible that the platform or service you are using to track the price of your investment only updates the information once per day. In this case, the investment itself may be traded more frequently, but the platform is only showing the most recent price at the end of the trading day.If you need more up-to-date information on the price of your investment, you may be able to find it on other financial websites or by contacting the company or organization that manages the investment. It's important to keep in mind, however, that the price of an investment can change rapidly and may not always be immediately reflected in the information that is available.","The price of an investment is typically only updated once per day because it reflects the closing price of the investment on a particular day. The closing price is the price at which the investment is traded at the end of the day, after the market has closed.There can be fluctuations in the price of an investment during the trading day, but these fluctuations are not reflected in the closing price until the next trading day. This means that the price of an investment will only be updated once per day, at the end of the trading day.There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, some investments, such as futures contracts and options, may have prices that are updated more frequently.

{"question":"Are there \u201cbuy and hold\u201d passively managed funds?","human_answers":["They pretty much already have what you are looking for.  They are called Unit Investment Trusts.  The key behind these is (a)  the trust starts out with a fixed pool of securities.  It is completely unmanaged and there is no buying or selling of the securities, (b) they terminate after a fixed period of time, at which time all assets are distributed among the owners. According to Investment Company Institute, \"securities in a UIT are   professionally selected to meet a stated investment objective,  such   as growth,  income, or capital appreciation.\" UITs sell a fixed    number of units at one-time  public offering. Securities in a UIT do    not trade actively, rather, UITs use a  strategy known as    buy-and-hold. The UIT purchases a certain amount of  securities and    holds them until its termination date. Holdings rarely change   throughout the life of the trust so unit holders know exactly what    they're  investing in, and the trust lists all securities in its    prospectus. Unit trusts  normally sell redeemable units - this    obligates the trust to re-purchase  investor's units at their net    asset value at the investors request."],"chatgpt_answers":["Yes, there are passively managed funds that follow a \"buy and hold\" strategy. Passive funds, also known as index funds, aim to track the performance of a specific market index by holding a portfolio of securities that represents the index.

As a result, they generally have lower expense ratios and fewer portfolio turnover than actively managed funds.Passively managed funds that follow a \"buy and hold\" strategy typically have a long-term investment horizon and do not frequently buy and sell securities in an effort to time the market.

Their incentives also get aligned to the stock price."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several reasons why a company might care about the price of its own shares in the stock market.Share price can be a reflection of the company's financial performance and investor confidence in its future prospects. A high share price may indicate that investors believe the company is financially healthy and will continue to grow in the future, while a low share price may suggest that investors are concerned about the company's financial performance or future prospects.Share price can affect the company's ability to raise capital. If a company's shares are trading at a high price, it may be able to raise capital more easily by selling additional shares to investors. Conversely, if a company's shares are trading at a low price, it may be more difficult for the company to raise capital through the sale of additional shares.Share price can impact the wealth of the company's shareholders. If the share price increases, the value of a shareholder's investment in the company will also increase, which can lead to higher returns for the shareholder. On the other hand, if the share price decreases, the value of the shareholder's investment will also decrease, which can lead to lower returns for the shareholder.Share price can affect the company's reputation. A high share price may be seen as a sign of the company's success and may help to improve its reputation, while a low share price may be seen as a sign of financial difficulties and may damage the company's reputation.Overall, a company may care about the price of its own shares in the stock market because it can have a significant impact on the company's financial performance, ability to raise capital, shareholder wealth, and reputation."]},

{"question":"I was given a 1099-misc instead of a w-2 what are my next steps?","human_answers":["I agree that you should have received both a 1099 and a W2 from your employer. They may be reluctant to do that because some people believe that could trigger an IRS audit. The reason is that independent contractor vs employee is supposed to be defined by your job function, not by your choice. If you were a contractor and then switched to be an employee without changing your job description, then the IRS could claim that you should have always been an employee the entire time, and so should every one of the other contractors that work for that company with a similar job function. It's a hornet's nest that the employer may not want to poke. But that's not your problem; what should you do about it? When you say \"he added my Federal and FICA W\/H together\", do you mean that total appears in box 4 of your 1099? If so, it sounds like the employer is expecting you to re-pay the employer portion of FICA. Can you ask them if they actually paid it? If they did, then I don't see them having a choice but to issue a W2, since the IRS would be expecting one. If they didn't pay your FICA, then the amount this will cost you is 7.65% of what would have been your W2 wages. IMHO it would be reasonable for you to request that they send you a check for that extra amount. Note: even though that amount will be less than $600 and you won't receive a 1099 in 2017 for it, legally you'll still have to pay tax on that amount so I think a good estimate would be to call it 10% instead. Depending on your personality and your relationship with the employer, if they choose not to \"make you whole\", you could threaten to fill out form SS-8. Additional Info: (Thank you Bobson for bringing this up.) The situation you find yourself in is similar to the concept of \"Contract-to-Hire\". You start off as a contractor, and later convert to an employee. In order to avoid issuing a 1099 and W2 to the same person in a single tax year, companies typically utilize one of the following strategies: Your particular situation is closest to situation 2, but the reverse. Instead of retroactively calling you a W2 employee the entire time, your employer is cheating and attempting to classify you as a 1099 contractor the entire time. This is frowned upon by the IRS, as well as the employee since as you discovered it costs you more money in the form of employer FICA. From your description it sounds like your employer was trying to do you a favor and didn't quite follow through with it. What they should have done was never switch you to W2 in the first place (if you really should have been a contractor), or they should have done the conversion properly without stringing you along."],"chatgpt_answers":["If you received a 1099-MISC form instead of a W-2, it generally means that you were paid as an independent contractor rather than an employee. As an independent contractor, you are responsible for paying your own taxes, rather than having them withheld from your pay by an employer.Here are the steps you should take:Determine your tax liability: You will need to calculate the total amount of income you received as an independent contractor and determine the amount of tax you owe on that income. You may need to pay self-employment tax in addition to regular income tax.File a tax return: If you received more than $400 in income as an independent contractor, you are required to file a tax return. You can use IRS Form 1040 to report your independent contractor income and calculate your tax liability.Pay your taxes: If you owe taxes, you will need to pay them by the tax filing deadline, which is typically April 15th. You can make a payment online, by phone, or by mail using a check or money order.Keep good records: It's important to keep good records of your independent contractor income and any expenses you incur in the course of your work.

{"question":"Mortgage company withholding insurance proceeds","human_answers":["Fire insurance, as you have discovered, is a complete ripoff. Most people pay fire insurance all their lives with no benefit whatsoever, and those such as yourself who are lucky enough to get a payout find that it is completely insufficient to replace their loss. I once computed the actual beneficial net present financial value of my fire insurance policy and it came out to $40 per month. The cost was $800 per month. That is typical. Homeowners pay $500 to $800 per year for something that is worth $30 to $50 per year. Ironically banks would actually make more money from mortgages if they did not require mortgagees to buy insurance, but nevertheless they insist on it. It is not about logic, but about fear and irrationality. When I paid off my mortgage and gained ownership of my home the first thing I did was cancel my fire insurance. I now invest the money I would have wasted on insurance, making money instead of losing it. Being compelled to throw money down the toilet on fire insurance is one of the hidden costs of a homeowners mortgage in the United States. In your situation, the main option is to borrow the money to rebuild the house using the land as collateral, if the land is valuable enough. Of course, you still owe the money for your original mortgage on your now (non-existent) home. So, to get a home, you will have to have the income to service two mortgages. A loan officer at a reputable bank can tell you whether you have the income necessary to support two mortgages. If you were maxed out on your original mortgage, then you may not have enough income and you are screwed. In that case you will have to go back to renting and gradually paying off your old mortgage.

The gain from the sale of the property will be calculated in the same way as it would be for property located within the United States.To calculate the gain, you will need to determine the difference between the sales price and your tax basis in the property. Your tax basis is generally the cost of the property, including any improvements that you made to it, plus any closing costs associated with the purchase. If you have owned the property for a long time, you may have a higher tax basis due to depreciation that you have claimed over the years.If the sales price is greater than your tax basis, you will have a gain on the sale. The gain will be taxed at the applicable capital gains tax rate, which depends on your income tax bracket.If you receive payment for the sale of the property in a foreign currency, you will need to convert the amount of the sale to U.S. dollars in order to report it on your tax return. You can use the exchange rate that was in effect on the date of the sale. If you receive multiple payments for the sale of the property, you will need to convert each payment to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate that was in effect on the date of each payment.It is important to keep good records of the sale of the property, including documentation of the sales price, the tax basis in the property, and any closing costs or other expenses associated with the sale.

Unless you definitely know you are living in the area for a good long time, avoid buying a house and get a car instead."],"chatgpt_answers":["As a recent college graduate, it's important to consider your financial situation and long-term goals before making a decision about whether to save for a down payment on a house or a car. Here are a few things to consider:Your budget: Make sure you have a clear understanding of your income and expenses, and how much you can afford to put towards a down payment. Remember to factor in the ongoing costs of owning a house or car, such as mortgage payments, property taxes, and insurance.Your long-term goals: Consider your long-term financial goals and whether owning a house or a car aligns with those goals. For example, if you want to be financially stable and build wealth over the long term, owning a house may be a good choice, as it can be a good investment. On the other hand, if you're not sure where you'll be living or working in the near future, it might make more sense to focus on a car, which is more portable.Your financial priorities: It's also important to consider your other financial priorities, such as paying off student loans or saving for retirement. It may make more sense to focus on these priorities before saving for a down payment on a house or car.Ultimately, the decision about whether to save for a down payment on a house or car will depend on your individual circumstances and financial goals.

What kind of taxes are we looking into paying into the business   (besides setup of everything) compared to being a self proprietor?   (I'm seeing that the general answer is no, as long as income is <200k,   but not certain). Unless you decide to have your LLC taxed as a corporation, there's no change in taxes. LLC, by default, is a pass-through entity and all income will flow to your respective tax returns. From tax perspective, the LLC will be treated as a partnership. It will file form 1065 to report its income, and allocate the income to the members\/partners on schedules K-1 which will be given to you. You'll use the numbers on the K-1 to transfer income allocated to you to your tax returns and pay taxes on that.

Your contract counterparts couldn't care less about your tax problems. Unless you are a corporation, people who pay you more than $600 a year must file a 1099. Since you'll be a partnership, you'll need to provide the partnership EIN instead of your own SSN, but that's the only difference. Are LLC's required to pay taxes 4 times per year? We would definitely   get an accountant for things, but being as this is side work, there   will be times where we choose to not take on clients, which could   cause multiple months of no income. Obviously we would save for when   we need to pay taxes, but is there a magic number that says \"you must   now pay four times per year\". Unless you choose to tax your LLC as a corporation, LLC will pay no taxes. You will need to make sure you have enough withholding to cover for the additional income, or pay the quarterly estimates. The magic number is $1000. If your withholding+estimates is $1000 less than what your tax liability is, you'll be penalized, unless the total withholding+estimates is more than 100% of your prior year tax liability (or 110%, depending on the amounts). The LLC would be 50% 50%, but that work would not always be that. We   will be taking on smaller project through the company, so there will   be times where one of us could potentially be making more money. Are   we setting ourselves up for disaster if one is payed more than the   other while still having equal ownership? Partnerships can be very flexible, and equity split doesn't have to be the same as income, loss or assets split.

{"question":"What is vested stock and yearly dividends?","human_answers":["Vesting As you may know a stock option is the right to acquire a given amount of stock at a given price.  Actually acquiring the stock is referred to as exercising the option.  Your company is offering you options over 200,000 shares but not all of those options can be exercised immediately. Initially you will only be able to acquire 25,000 shares; the other 175,000 have conditions attached, the condition in this case presumably being that you are still employed by the company at the specified time in the future.  When the conditions attached to a stock option are satisfied that option is said to have vested - this simply means that the holder of the option can now exercise that option at any time they choose and thereby acquire the relevant shares. Dividends Arguably the primary purpose of most private companies is to make money for their owners (i.e. the shareholders) by selling goods and\/or services at a profit.  How does that money actually get to the shareholders?  There are a few possible ways of which paying a dividend is one.  Periodically (potentially annually but possibly more or less frequently or irregularly) the management of a company may look at how it is doing and decide that it can afford to pay so many cents per share as a dividend.  Every shareholder would then receive that number of cents multiplied by the number of shares held. So for example in 4 years or so, after all your stock options have vested and assuming you have exercised them you will own 200,000 shares in your company.  If the board declares a dividend of 10 cents per share you would receive $20,000.  Depending on where you are and your exact circumstances you may or may not have to pay tax on this. Those are the basic concepts - as you might expect there are all kinds of variations and complications that can occur, but that's hopefully enough to get you started."],"chatgpt_answers":["Vested stock refers to shares of stock that an employee has the right to own or sell. This typically occurs after the employee has worked for a company for a certain period of time, or has met certain performance targets.Yearly dividends are payments made to shareholders of a company, typically paid out of the company's profits. These dividends are usually paid on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually. Shareholders are entitled to receive a portion of the company's profits in the form of dividends, based on the number of shares they own.For example, if a company declares a dividend of $1 per share, and an employee owns 100 shares of vested stock in the company, the employee would receive a dividend payment of $100.

The tax would be applied uniformly to all new goods and services, with some exceptions for necessities such as food, clothing, and medical care. The Fair Tax would be collected by state and local governments, rather than by the federal government, and would be paid directly by consumers at the point of purchase.Proponents of the Fair Tax argue that it would simplify the tax system, reduce compliance costs, and increase economic growth by eliminating the disincentives to work and invest created by income and payroll taxes. They also argue that it would be more progressive than the current tax system because it would exempt low-income households from tax and impose a higher tax rate on higher-income households, who tend to consume more.However, critics of the Fair Tax argue that it would disproportionately burden lower- and middle-income households, who tend to spend a higher percentage of their income on consumption, and that it would be difficult to enforce and could lead to tax evasion.

Short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate and apply to assets that you held for one year or less. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate and apply to assets that you held for more than one year.If you sell the covered call option at a loss, that loss is considered a capital loss and can be used to offset capital gains you may have realized in other transactions during the year. If you have more capital losses than capital gains, you may be able to use the excess losses to reduce your taxable income by up to $3,000 in a given tax year. Any excess losses above that amount can be carried over to future tax years and used to offset capital gains in those years.","Proceeds from writing covered calls are generally taxed as short-term capital gains.

Many private student loans have a grace period of six to nine months after you leave school, during which you are not required to make payments. However, interest may accrue during this period, so it's a good idea to make at least some payments to reduce the amount of interest that accumulates on your loans.If you have federal student loans, you may have a longer grace period of up to six months.

You say that \"a great many companies\" failed during the recession, but that's not actually true.  I can't think of more than a handful of publically-traded companies that went bankrupt.

I have one credit card which I only use on vacations because some countries don't take my debit card, and I always put money on it before I use it, so I've technically never borrowed money from a bank at all. My banker looked at my SCHUFA with me and we saw that there was nothing in there except for the credit card, which has a 500\u20ac limit and if I maxed it out, the monthly interest would be 6,80\u20ac so he added that 6,80\u20ac to my expenses calculation and that was it.

{"question":"Higher returns from international markets?","human_answers":["Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile -- higher risk trades off against higher return potential, always. The better reason for having some money in that area is that, as with bonds, it moves out-of-sync with the US markets and once you pick your preferred distribution, maintaining that balance semi-automatically takes advantage of that to improve your return-vs-risk position. I have a few percent of my total investments in an international stock index fund, and a few percent in an international REIT, both being fairly low-fee. (Low fees mean more of the money reaches you, and seems to be one of the better reasons for preferring one fund over another following the same segment of the market.)

Because that OP did not specify that this is an interest-only loan (you still haven't in any of your questions), the bank will require you to make payments back to them each month that include principal and interest.

But with the set up laid out in this post, and with the assumptions I specified there, the principal payments must be included because the borrower has to pay back the bank and isn't not tying up any of their own money.  In that case, my initial analysis is correct--your breakeven is in the low teens for an annual required return.  The Second Proposal Your second proposal... before any edits... refined things a little bit, to try to capture the any possible returns by not selling something. As I indicated there, (with what was an exaggerating assumption), the lack of clarity makes for an outlandish required return.  The Second Proposal...with edits, or the one proposed above I will get to the one proposed above in a second, but first let me highlight a few problems with your friend's analysis.  Simple interest: the only place (in the US at least) that will lend with simple interest is student loans. Any loan that you actually take out will be compound interest.  Not an interest only loan: your \"friend\" is not calculating interest correctly. Since this isn't an interest-only loan, the principal balance will reduce every time you make a payment, by ~$320-$340 each month. This substantially reduces the total interest paid, to $272.79 over the total 24 months.  \"Returns\": I don't know what country, or what business your friend works in, but \"returns\" are a very ambiguous concept. Investopedia defines returns as gains or losses. (I wish I could inhabit the lala land that your friend lives in when returns are always positive). TheFreeDictionary.com defines a return for finance as \"The change in the value of a portfolio over an evaluation period, including any distributions made from the portfolio during that period.\"  When you have not made it clear that any other money is being used in this investment plan (as was the case in scheme #1 and scheme #2a,) the loan still has to be paid. So, clearly the principal must be included in the return calculations.  How to evaluate this proposed investment scheme Key dimensions: Loan ($8,000 ... 24 months ... 0.27% monthly rate... monthly compounding... no loan origination fees) Monthly payment (PMT in Excel yields $344.70). Investment capital (starting = $8,000) Monthly Return (Investment yields... we hope it's positive!)  Your monthly contribution from your salary Taxes = 10%. Transaction Fees = $20  Go and lookup how to build an amortization table for a loan in Excel. Your life will be infinitely better for it.  Now, you get this loan set up and invested into something... (it costs $20 to buy the assets).  So you've got $7980 chugging away earning interest. I calculate that your break even, with you paying in $344.70 of your own money each month is 1.81% annually, or 3.42% over the 24 month life of this scheme. That is using monthly compound interest for the payments, because that's what the real world would use, and using monthly compounding of the investments' returns.  Your total interest expense would be $272.79.  This seems feasible. But let's talk about what your other option is, given that you're ready to spend $344.70 each month on an investment.  Your other option  I understand the appeal of getting $8,000... right away... to invest in something. But the risk behind this is that if the market goes down (and markets do) you're stuck paying a fixed amount for your loan that is now worth less money.  Your other option is to take your $344.70, and invest it step-by-step. (You would want to skip a month or two buying assets in the market, so that you can lessen transaction costs). This has two advantages: (1) you save yourself $272 in interest. (2) When the market goes down, you still win.  With this strategy, you still win when the market goes down because of what is commonly called \"dollar cost averaging\". When the market is up, your investments are also up. When the market goes down, your previous investments decrease in value but you can invest new money at the lower rates.  Why the step-by-step, invest your own money strategy is better At low rates (when you're looking for your break-even), the step-by-step model outperforms the loan. At higher rates of return (~4% + per year), you get the benefit of having the borrowed money earning more gains.  In fact, for every continuous (meaning set... not changing month-to-month) interest rate that you can dream up that is greater than about 4% per year, the borrowed money earns more.  At 10% per year, the borrowed money will earn about $500 more over the 2 years than your step by step investment would.  BUT I recognize that you might feel like the market will always go up. That's what everyone thinks. And that's alright.  But have one really bad month, or a couple of just-not-great-months, and your fixed 'loan' portfolio will underperform. Have a few really bad months, and your portfolio could be substantially reduced in value... but you would still be paying the same amount for it each month.  And if that happened (say your assets declined -3% in 3 of the 24 months...) You'd be losing money relative to the step-by-step portfolio."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is generally not a good idea to take out a loan in order to invest. The main reason for this is that investing carries inherent risks, and if the investment does not perform well, you may end up losing money and still be responsible for repaying the loan. This can put you in a financially precarious position and make it difficult to meet your monthly loan payments.If you are considering taking out a loan to invest, it is important to carefully consider the risks and potential rewards of the investment. You should also have a solid plan in place for how you will pay back the loan, including a realistic assessment of your monthly income and expenses.Alternatively, if you have a stable income and are looking to invest, you may want to consider saving up and investing with your own money rather than borrowing.

{"question":"FHA Reduction Notices From Third-Party Companies - Scam? Or Something To Consider?","human_answers":["This is obviously a spam mail. Your mortgage is a public record, and mortgage brokers and insurance agents were, are and will be soliciting your business, as long as they feel they have a chance of getting it. Nothing that that particular company offers is unique to them, nothing they can offer you cannot be done by anyone else. It is my personal belief that we should not do business with spammers, and that is why I suggest you to remember the company name and never deal with them. However, it is up to you if you want to follow that advice or not. What they're offering is called refinance. Any bank, credit union or mortgage broker does that. The rates are more or less the same everywhere, but the closing fees and application fees is where the small brokers are making their money. Big banks get their money from also servicing the loans, so they're more flexible on fees. All of them can do \"streamline\" refinance if your mortgage is eligible. None if it isn't. Note that the ones who service your current mortgage might not be the ones who own it, thus \"renegotiating the rate\" is most likely not an option (FHA backed loans are sold to Fannie and Freddie, the original lenders continue servicing them - but don't own them). Refinancing - is a more likely option, and in this case the lender will not care about your rate on the old mortgage."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is important to be cautious of any unsolicited offers or notices you receive, especially those that involve financial matters.

{"question":"Calculating pay off for credit card with multiple APRs","human_answers":["The first thing you need to do is look at your terms and conditions of your credit card, or ask your bank, how they will apply the payments.  As Dilip notes in his answer, in the US, they will likely apply the minimum payment to the lower rate balance, and then must apply the rest above the minimum to the higher rate balance.  In other countries, this will vary by law and custom.  Do not assume it will pay off the higher balance, or proportionally, without asking. Let's take the following example. You owe $6000.  $5000 is at 13.5% (normal purchase rate) and $1000 is at 22% (cash advance rate).  If your bank applies payments to both balances proportionally, then a payment of $600 will reduce your purchase balance by $500 and your cash advance balance by $100. The average APR, then, is simply sum of the product of the APR times balance.  So here, (.135*5000 + .225*1000)\/6000 = 15%.  This is called a weighted average. If the bank applies the payment differently - such as to the lower rate first, or some specified part to the lower rate and the rest to the higher rate - then this will be misleading if you enter it into a calculator, because your average APR will rise over time as you pay off the purchase balance but don't pay off the cash advance balance, or may decrease if the opposite happens. The weighted average is probably reasonably close in the circumstance that you describe, even if you have rules applying the balance differently, so long as they don't 100% pay down the lower rate - so it may be the simplest option for you in terms of rough calculations (where it's not critical to be correct, just close). One approach using the online calculators that might be better, is to treat these like two separate loans\/cards.  Many calculators exist for multiple balances.  Then you can allocate funds differently to the two 'cards'.  This would allow you to see how long you will need until you've paid off the higher balance, for example, although it probably won't perfectly match things - unless you find a site that has this specific option available you probably will have to either live with a small error in your calculations or do the math by hand."],"chatgpt_answers":["To calculate the pay off for a credit card with multiple APRs, you will need to calculate the balance for each APR separately, then add them together to get the total balance. Here's how to do it:List all the APR rates and the corresponding balances for each rate.Calculate the minimum payment for each APR rate. To do this, multiply the balance by the APR rate, then divide by the number of months in a year (12). For example, if the balance is $1000 and the APR is 20%, the minimum payment would be $1000 * 20% \/ 12 = $166.67.Calculate the total minimum payment by adding the minimum payments for each APR rate.Calculate the total interest paid by subtracting the total minimum payment from the total balance.Repeat the process until the balance is paid off, making sure to pay the minimum payment for each APR rate each month.It's important to note that the above calculation assumes that you are only making the minimum payment and not paying more towards the balance. If you are able to pay more than the minimum payment each month, you will be able to pay off the balance more quickly and pay less in total interest.It's also a good idea to try to pay off the balances with the highest APR rates first, as they will accrue more interest over time. This can help you save money on interest in the long run."]},

{"question":"Can another tax loss be used to offset capital gains taxes? How does it work?","human_answers":["Capital losses do mirror capital gains within their holding periods. An asset or investment this is certainly held for a year into the day or less, and sold at a loss, will create a short-term capital loss. A sale of any asset held for over a year to your day, and sold at a loss, will create a loss that is long-term. When capital gains and losses are reported from the tax return, the taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses between long and short term, and then aggregate the sum total amounts for every single regarding the four categories. Then the gains that are long-term losses are netted against each other, therefore the same is done for short-term gains and losses. Then your net gain that is long-term loss is netted against the net short-term gain or loss. This final net number is then reported on Form 1040. Example Frank has the following gains and losses from his stock trading for the year: Short-term gains - $6,000 Long-term gains - $4,000 Short-term losses - $2,000 Long-term losses - $5,000 Net short-term gain\/loss - $4,000 ST gain ($6,000 ST gain - $2,000 ST loss) Net long-term gain\/loss - $1,000 LT loss ($4,000 LT gain - $5,000 LT loss) Final net gain\/loss - $3,000 short-term gain ($4,000 ST gain - $1,000 LT loss)   Again, Frank can only deduct $3,000 of final net short- or long-term losses against other types of income for that year and must carry forward any remaining balance."],"chatgpt_answers":["Yes, it is possible to use a tax loss to offset capital gains taxes.

If you have more capital losses than capital gains, you may be able to use the excess losses to offset other types of income, up to a maximum of $3,000 per year.

There are several monetary thresholds that separate your class from a more well funded class. 1) You cannot use margin with less than $2000 dollars Brokers require that you have at least $2000 before they will lend to you 2) In 2010, Congress banned under 21 year olds from getting access to credit. UNLESS they get cosigned. This means that even if you have $2000, no broker will give you margin unless you have a (good) credit history already. There was a good reason for this, but its based on the assumption that everyone is stupid, not the assumption that some people are objective thinkers. 3) The brokers that will open an account for you have high commissions. The commissions are so high that it will destroy any capital gains you may make with your $1000. For the most part. 4) The pattern day trader rule. You cannot employ sophisticated risk management while being subject to the pattern day trader rule. It basically limits you from trading 3 times a day (its more complicated than that read it yourself) if you have less than $25,000 in one account. 5) Non-trade or stock related investments: Buy municipal or treasury bonds.

In general the best I can say is your business expense may be deductible.  But it depends on the circumstances and what it is you want to deduct. Travel Taxpayers who travel away from home on business may deduct related   expenses, including the cost of reaching their destination, the cost   of lodging and meals and other ordinary and necessary expenses.   Taxpayers are considered \u201ctraveling away from home\u201d if their duties   require them to be away from home substantially longer than an   ordinary day\u2019s work and they need to sleep or rest to meet the demands   of their work. The actual cost of meals and incidental expenses may be   deducted or the taxpayer may use a standard meal allowance and reduced   record keeping requirements. Regardless of the method used, meal   deductions are generally limited to 50 percent as stated earlier.    Only actual costs for lodging may be claimed as an expense and   receipts must be kept for documentation. Expenses must be reasonable   and appropriate; deductions for extravagant expenses are not   allowable. More information is available in Publication 463, Travel,   Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses. Entertainment Expenses for entertaining clients, customers or employees may be   deducted if they are both ordinary and necessary and meet one of the   following tests: Directly-related test: The main purpose of the entertainment activity is the conduct of business, business was actually conducted   during the activity and the taxpayer had more than a general   expectation of getting income or some other specific business benefit   at some future time.

{"question":"Interest on security deposits paid to landlords, in Michigan?","human_answers":["No. The full text of the Landlord-Tenant Act (specifically, section 554.614 of Act 348 of the year 1972) makes no mention of this.

Specifically, section 554.604 of the same law states that: (1) The security deposit shall be deposited in a regulated financial   institution. A landlord may use the moneys so deposited for any   purposes he desires if he deposits with the secretary of state a cash   bond or surety bond written by a surety company licensed to do   business in this state and acceptable to the attorney general to   secure the entire deposits up to $50,000.00 and 25% of any amount   exceeding $50,000.00.

(2) The bond shall be for the benefit of persons making security   deposits with the landlord. A person for whose benefit the bond is   written or his legal representative may bring an action in the   district, common pleas or municipal court where the landlord resides   or does business for collection on the bond.

However, it is important for landlords to properly handle and account for the security deposit paid by a tenant.Under Michigan law, a landlord must provide the tenant with a written receipt for any security deposit received, and must also provide the tenant with a written statement of the condition of the rental unit within 14 days after the tenant moves in. If the landlord fails to do so, the tenant may be entitled to damages in an amount equal to twice the security deposit.If the tenant moves out and the landlord wishes to keep all or part of the security deposit, the landlord must provide the tenant with a written statement itemizing any damages and the cost of repairs within 30 days after the tenant vacates the rental unit. If the landlord fails to do so, the tenant may be entitled to the return of the full security deposit.It is also important for landlords to properly handle and account for security deposits, as they are considered the property of the tenant and must be kept separate from the landlord's own funds. Landlords are required to return the security deposit, or any remaining balance after deducting for damages, to the tenant within 30 days of the tenant vacating the rental unit.If you have further questions about security deposits in Michigan, you may want to consult a local attorney or contact the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs."]},
{"question":"Understanding Put Options","human_answers":["Options, both puts and calls, are typically written\/sold at different strike prices. For example, even though the stock of XYZ is currently trading at $12.50, there could be put options for prices ranging from $0.50 to $30.00, just as an example. There are several factors that go into determining the strike prices at which people are willing to write options. The writer\/seller of an option is the person on the other side of the trade that has the opposite opinion of you. If you are interested in purchasing a put on a stock to hedge your downside, that means the writer\/seller of the put is betting that you are wrong and that the stock price will rise instead."],"chatgpt_answers":["A put option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a certain quantity of an underlying asset at a predetermined price (also known as the strike price) on or before a specified date (the expiration date). The person who sells the put option is known as the writer.The buyer of a put option is betting that the price of the underlying asset will decrease below the strike price before the expiration date. If the price does indeed fall below the strike price, the buyer can exercise the option, sell the underlying asset at the strike price, and make a profit.For example, suppose you buy a put option on a stock with a strike price of $50 and an expiration date three months from now. If the stock price falls below $50 within the next three months, you can exercise the option and sell the stock at $50, even if the current market price is lower. If the stock price stays above $50, however, you will not exercise the option and will lose the premium you paid for the put option.The writer of the put option, on the other hand, is betting that the price of the underlying asset will stay above the strike price. If the price stays above the strike price, the option will expire worthless and the writer will keep the premium as profit. If the price falls below the strike price, however, the writer will have to buy the underlying asset at the higher market price and sell it to the option holder at the lower strike price, resulting in a loss."]},

Dividends are typically paid in cash, but they can also be paid in the form of additional shares of the company's stock. Dividends are usually paid out on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually.When a company pays dividends, it can affect your position in the company in a few ways. If you own shares of the company's stock, you will typically receive a dividend payment for each share you own. This can provide you with a source of income and can potentially increase your return on investment in the stock.However, if you own shares in a company that is paying dividends, the value of the stock may decrease by an amount roughly equal to the value of the dividends paid.

Pay close attention to the end date, because you do not want to pay 22% interest on the entire amount.   This also requires that you watch your card balance carefully.  All payments are usually put to current purchases (i.e. those not under a plan) first, before they are applied to the plan balance.

{"question":"How much do large sell orders affect stock price?","human_answers":["Most of the investors who have large holdings in a particular stock have pretty good exit strategies for those positions to ensure they are getting the best price they can by selling gradually into the volume over time. Putting a single large block of stock up for sale is problematic for one simple reason: Let's say you have 100,000 shares of a stock, and for some reason you decide today is the day to sell them, take your profits, and ride off into the sunset.  So you call your broker (or log into your brokerage account) and put them up for sale.  He puts in an order somewhere, the stock is sold, and your account is credited. Seems simple, right?  Well...not so fast. Professionals - I'm keeping this simple, so please don't beat me up for it! The way stocks are bought and sold is through companies known as \"market makers\".  These are entities which sit between the markets and you (and your broker), and when you want to buy or sell a stock, most of the time the order is ultimately handled somewhere along the line by a market maker.  If you work with a large brokerage firm, sometimes they'll buy or sell your shares out of their own accounts, but that's another story. It is normal for there to be many, sometimes hundreds, of market makers who are all trading in the same equity.  The bigger the stock, the more market makers it attracts.  They all compete with each other for business, and they make their money on the spread between what they buy stock from people selling for and what they can get for it selling it to people who want it. Given that there could be hundreds of market makers on a particular stock (Google, Apple, and Microsoft are good examples of having hundreds of market makers trading in their stocks), it is very competitive.  The way the makers compete is on price.  It might surprise you to know that it is the market makers, not the markets, that decide what a stock will buy or sell for. Each market maker sets their own prices for what they'll pay to buy from sellers for, and what they'll sell it to buyers for.  This is called, respectively, the \"bid\" and the \"ask\" prices.  So, if there are hundreds of market makers then there could be hundreds of different bid and ask prices on the same stock.  The prices you see for stocks are what are called the \"best bid and best ask\" prices.  What that means is, you are being shown the highest \"bid\" price (what you can sell your shares for) and the best \"ask\" price (what you can buy those shares for) because that's what is required.  That being said, there are many other market makers on the same stock whose bid prices are lower and ask prices are higher.  Many times there will be a big clump of market makers all at the same bid\/ask, or within fractions of a cent of each other, all competing for business.  Trading computers are taught to seek out the best prices and the fastest trade fills they can. The point to this very simplistic lesson is that the market makers set the prices that shares trade at.  They adjust those prices based (among other factors) on how much buying and selling volume they're seeing.  If they see a wave of sell orders coming into the system then they'll start marking down their bid prices.  This keeps them from paying too much for shares they're going to have to find a buyer for eventually, and it can sometimes slow down the pace of selling as investors and automated systems notice the price decline and decide to wait to sell.  Conversely, if market makers see a wave of buy orders coming into the system, they'll start marking their ask prices up to maximize their gains, since they're selling you shares they bought from someone else, presumably at a lower price.  But they typically adjust their prices up or down before they actually fill trades.  (sneaky, eh?) Depending on how much volume there is on the shares of the company you're selling, and depending on whether there are more buyers than sellers at the moment, your share sell order may be filled at market by a market maker with no real consequence to the share's price. If the block is large enough then it's possible it will not all sell to one market maker, or it might not all happen in one transaction or even all at the same price. This is a pretty complex subject, as you can see, and I've cut a LOT of corners and oversimplified much to keep it comprehensible.  But the short answer to your question is -- it depends. Hope this helps. Good luck!"],"chatgpt_answers":["The effect of large sell orders on stock price can vary depending on several factors, such as the size of the sell order relative to the overall trading volume of the stock, the current supply and demand for the stock, and the underlying fundamental factors that are driving the stock's performance.In general, large sell orders can have a downward pressure on the stock price, as they represent a significant influx of supply onto the market. If there are not enough buyers willing to absorb this additional supply, the price of the stock may decrease as sellers reduce their asking prices in order to attract buyers.However, it is also important to note that stock prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic conditions, company performance, and market sentiment.

For the sake of simplicity, I'll assume that your investments in stocks are in nice, passive indexed mutual funds and ETFs, rather than in individual stocks. A 90% allocation in stocks is considered aggressive. The problem is that if the stock market crashes, you may lose 40% or more of your investment in a single year. As you point out, you are investing for the long term. That's great, it means you can rest easy if the stock market crashes, safe in the hope that you have many years for it to recover. So long as you have the emotional willpower to stick with it. Would you be better off with a 100% allocation in stocks? You'd think so, wouldn't you. After all, the stock market as a whole gives better expected returns than the bond market. But keep in mind, the stock market and the bond market are (somewhat) negatively correlated. That means when the stock market goes down, the bond market often goes up, and vice versa. Investing some of your money in bonds will slightly reduce your expected return but will also reduce your standard deviation and your maximum annual loss. Canadian Couch Potato has an interesting write-up on how to estimate stock and bond returns. It's based on your stocks being invested equally in the Canadian, U.S., and international markets. As you live in the U.S., that likely doesn't directly apply to you; you probably ignore the Canadian stock market, but your returns will be fairly similar. I've reproduced part of that table here: As you can see, your expected return is highest with a 100% allocation in stocks. With a 20 year window, you likely can recover from any crash. If you have the stomach for it, it's the allocation with the highest expected return. Once you get closer to retirement, though, you have less time to wait for the stock market to recover. If you still have 90% or 100% of your investment in stocks and the market crashes by 44%, it might well take you more than 6 years to recover. Canadian Couch Potato has another article, Does a 60\/40 Portfolio Still Make Sense? A 60\/40 portfolio is a fairly common split for regular investors. Typically considered not too aggressive, not too conservative. The article references an AP article that suggests, in the current financial climate, 60\/40 isn't enough. Even they aren't recommending a 90\/10 or a 100\/0 split, though. Personally, I think 60\/40 is too conservative. However, I don't have the stomach for a 100\/0 split or even a 90\/10 split. Okay, to get back to your question. So long as your time horizon is far enough out, the expected return is highest with a 100% allocation in stocks. Be sure that you can tolerate the risk, though. A 30% or 40% hit to your investments is enough to make anyone jittery. Investing a portion of your money in bonds slightly lowers your expected return but can measurably reduce your risk. As you get closer to retirement and your time horizon narrows, you have less time to recover from a stock market crash and do need to be more conservative. 6 years is probably too short to keep all your money in stocks. Is your stated approach reasonable? Well, only you can answer that. :)"],"chatgpt_answers":["As people age, their risk tolerance tends to decrease. This is because as we get older, we have more to lose and may be more financially responsible for others, such as children or grandchildren. We may also be closer to retirement and therefore have less time to recover from any financial losses. Additionally, as we age, our physical and mental abilities may not be as strong as they were in our younger years, which can also affect our risk tolerance.That being said, everyone's risk tolerance is different and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including personal circumstances, financial goals, and individual personality traits. It's important to carefully consider your own risk tolerance and to make investment decisions that align with your overall financial plan and goals."]},

{"question":"Are stock index fund likely to keep being a reliable long-term investment option?","human_answers":["A diversified portfolio (such as a 60% stocks \/ 40% bonds balanced fund) is much more predictable and reliable than an all-stocks portfolio, and the returns are perfectly adequate. The extra returns on 100% stocks vs. 60% are 1.2% per year (historically) according to https:\/\/personal.vanguard.com\/us\/insights\/saving-investing\/model-portfolio-allocations To get those average higher stock returns, you need to be thinking 20-30 years (even 10 years is too short-term). Over the 20-30 years, you must never panic and go to cash, or you will destroy the higher returns. You must never get discouraged and stop saving, or you will destroy the higher returns. You have to avoid the panic and discouragement despite the likelihood that some 10-year period in your 20-30 years the stock market will go nowhere. You also must never have an emergency or other reason to withdraw money early. If you look at \"dry periods\" in stocks, like 2000 to 2011, a 60\/40 portfolio made significant money and stocks went nowhere. A diversified portfolio means that price volatility makes you money (due to rebalancing) while a 100% stocks portfolio means that price volatility is just a lot of stress with no benefit. It's somewhat possible, probably, to predict dry periods in stocks; if I remember the statistics, about 50% of the variability in the market price 10 years out can be explained by normalized market valuation (normalized = adjusted for business cycle and abnormal profit margins). Some funds such as http:\/\/hussmanfunds.com\/ are completely based on this, though a lot of money managers consider it. With a balanced portfolio and rebalancing, though, you don't have to worry about it very much. In my view, the proper goal is not to beat the market, nor match the market, nor is it to earn the absolute highest possible returns. Instead, the goal is to have the highest chance of financing your non-financial goals (such as retirement, or buying a house). To maximize your chances of supporting your life goals with your financial decisions, predictability is more important than maximized returns. Your results are primarily determined by your savings rate - which realistic investment returns will never compensate for if it's too low. You can certainly make a 40-year projection in which 1.2% difference in returns makes a big difference. But you have to remember that a projection in which value steadily and predictably compounds is not the same as real life, where you could have emergency or emotional factors, where the market will move erratically and might have a big plunge at just the wrong time (end of the 40 years), and so on. If your plan \"relies\" on the extra 1.2% returns then it's not a reasonable plan anyhow, in my opinion, since you can't count on them. So why suffer the stress and extra risk created by an all-stocks portfolio?"],"chatgpt_answers":["Stock index funds have historically been a reliable long-term investment option and have the potential to continue being so in the future. Index funds are a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that track the performance of a particular stock market index, such as the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ Composite. These funds offer investors a convenient and low-cost way to diversify their portfolio by holding a broad range of stocks, rather than having to invest in individual stocks themselves.One of the main advantages of index funds is that they offer broad diversification, which can help to mitigate risk and smooth out returns over time. By holding a diverse portfolio of stocks, index funds are less vulnerable to the performance of any one individual stock or sector. In addition, index funds typically have low expenses compared to actively managed funds, which means that investors can keep more of their returns over the long term.Of course, it's important to keep in mind that past performance is not indicative of future results, and there are no guarantees when it comes to investing.

Currencies are traded in pairs, with one currency being bought and another sold at the same time. The value of a currency is determined by supply and demand, and currency markets are influenced by a variety of factors, including:Interest rates: Higher interest rates tend to make a currency more attractive to investors, as they can earn higher returns on their investments. As a result, currencies with higher interest rates tend to appreciate in value.Inflation: If a country's inflation rate is higher than that of its trading partners, its currency may depreciate in value. This is because high inflation reduces the purchasing power of a currency, making it less attractive to investors.Economic growth: Strong economic growth can lead to an appreciation in the value of a currency, as it indicates that a country's economy is expanding and may be able to pay back its debts.Political stability: Political stability can be a key factor in determining the value of a currency. If a country is perceived as being politically stable, it may attract more investment, which can lead to an appreciation in the value of its currency.Government debt: High levels of government debt can lead to a depreciation in the value of a currency, as investors may be concerned about the government's ability to pay back its debts.Central bank policy: Central banks can influence the value of a currency through their monetary policy decisions, such as setting interest rates or purchasing or selling government bonds.Exchange rate regimes: The exchange rate regime of a country, or how its currency is pegged to another currency, can also influence its value. For example, if a country's currency is pegged to the US dollar, it will tend to follow the value of the US dollar.Trade balances: A country's trade balance, or the difference between the value of its exports and imports, can also influence the value of its currency.

It is based on the principle that every financial transaction has two equal and opposite effects on a company's financial statements. This means that for every debit (expense) recorded in one account, there must be a corresponding credit (income) recorded in another account. The purpose of double-entry accounting is to ensure the accuracy and completeness of a company's financial records by requiring that every transaction be recorded in at least two accounts.Here is a basic tutorial on double-entry accounting for personal finance:Set up a chart of accounts. A chart of accounts is a list of all the accounts that a company uses to record its financial transactions. In personal finance, this might include accounts for cash, investments, liabilities (such as credit card debt), and assets (such as a house or car).Record transactions in the appropriate accounts. When you make a financial transaction, such as paying a bill or receiving a paycheck, you will need to record it in the appropriate accounts in your chart of accounts. For example, if you pay a bill, you would debit the expense account (such as \"utilities\") and credit the cash account.Prepare financial statements. Using the information recorded in your chart of accounts, you can prepare financial statements such as a balance sheet and an income statement. A balance sheet shows the financial position of a company at a specific point in time, including its assets, liabilities, and equity. An income statement shows a company's revenues and expenses over a specific period of time, such as a month or a year.Reconcile your accounts. To ensure the accuracy of your financial records, it is important to regularly reconcile your accounts. This involves comparing the balance in your chart of accounts to your bank statement or other records to make sure everything matches. If there are any discrepancies, you will need to investigate and make any necessary adjustments.Double-entry accounting can seem intimidating at first, but with practice it can be a powerful tool for managing your personal finances and ensuring the accuracy of your financial records."]},

{"question":"Why do the 1 and 2 euro cent coins exist and why are they used?","human_answers":["I guess other than tradition and inflation, probably because the merchants want them.   In the US, what currently costs $2.00 used to cost $0.10.   So 75 years ago, those individual cents made a pretty bid difference.  Inflation causes prices to go up, but doesn't get us to just change our currencies patterns. In your example, you are assuming that in an average day, the rounding errors you are willing to accept happen a couple of times.  2 or 3 cents here and there mean nothing to you.  However to the merchant, doing hundreds or thousands of transactions per day, those few cents up and down mean quite a bit in terms of profit. To an individual, looking at a time frame more than a single day (because who only participates in economies for a single day) there are potentially millions of transactions in a lifetime, mean potentially giving away millions of dollars because they didn't want to wait. And as for the comment that people working each 3 cents every 10 seconds, I would assume at least some of the time when they are waiting for rounding errors, they are not at work getting paid.  That concept is assuming that somebody is always willing to pay them for their time regardless of where that person is in the world; I have no facts and wild assumptions, but surely that can't be true for even a majority of workers. Finally, you should be happy if you happy to have an income high enough that you don't care about individual cents.  But there are those business people who see opportunity in folks like you and profit greatly from it.

{"question":"Investment Portfolio Setup for beginner","human_answers":["Some thoughts: 1) Do you have a significant emergency fund (3-6 months of after-tax living expenses)? If not, you stand to take a significant loss if you have an unexpected need for cash that is tied up in investments. What if you lose\/hate your job or your car breaks down? What if a you want to spend some time with a relative or significant other who learns they only have a few months to live? Having a dedicated emergency fund is an important way to avoid downside risk. 2) Lagerbaer has a good suggestion. Given that if you'd reinvested your dividends, the S&P 500 has returned about 3.5% over the last 5 years, you may be able to get a very nice risk-free return.  3) Do you have access to employer matching funds, such as in a 401(k) at work? If you get a dollar-for-dollar match, that is a risk-free pre-tax 100% return and should be a high priority. 4) What do you mean by \"medium\" volatility? Given that you are considering a 2\/3 equity allocation, it would not be at all out of the realm of possibility that your balance could fall by 15% or more in any given year and take several years to recover. If that would spook you, you may want to consider lowering your equity weights. A high quality bond fund may be a good fit. 5) Personally, I would avoid putting money into stocks that I didn't need back for 10 years. If you only want to tie your money up for 2-5 years, you are taking a significant risk that if prices fall, you won't have time to recover before you need your money back. The portfolio you described would be appropriate for someone with a long-term investment horizon and significant risk tolerance, which is usually the case for young people saving for retirement. However, if your goals are to invest for 2-5 years only, your situation would be significantly different.  6) You can often borrow from an investment account to purchase a primary residence, but you must pay that amount back in order to avoid significant taxes and fees, unless you plan to liquidate assets. If you plan to buy a house, saving enough to avoid PMI is a good risk-free return on your money. 7) In general, and ETF or index fund is a good idea, the key being to minimize the compound effect of expenses over the long term. There are many good choices a la Vanguard here to choose from. 8) Don't worry about \"Buy low, sell high\". Don't be a speculator, be an investor (that's my version of Anthony Bourdain's, \"don't be a tourist, be a traveler\"). A speculator wants to sell shares at a higher price than they were purchased at. An investor wants to share in the profits of a company as a part-owner. If you can consistently beat the market by trying to time your transactions, good for you - you can move to Wall Street and make millions. However, almost no one can do this consistently, and it doesn't seem worth it to me to try. I don't mean to discourage you from investing, just make sure you have your bases covered so that you don't have to cash out at a bad time. Best of luck! Edit Response to additional questions below. 1) Emergency fund. I would recommend not investing in anything other than cash equivalents (money market, short-term CDs, etc.) until you've built up an emergency fund. It makes sense to want to make the \"best\" use of your money, but you also have to account for risk. My concern is that if you were to experience one or more adverse life events, that you could lose a lot of money, or need to pay a lot in interest on credit card debt, and it would be prudent to self-insure against some of those risks. I would also recommend against using an investment account as an emergency fund account. Taking money out of investment accounts is inefficient because the commissions\/taxes\/fees can easily eat up a significant portion of your returns. Ideally, you would want to put money in and not touch it for a long time in order to take advantage of compounding returns. There are also high penalties for early disbursements from retirement funds. Just like you need enough money in your checking account to buy food and pay the rent every month, you need enough money in an emergency fund to pay for things that are a real possibility, even if they are less common. Using a credit card or an investment account is a relatively expensive way to do this. 2) Invest at all? I would recommend starting an emergency fund, and then beginning to invest for retirement. Once your retirement savings are on track, you can begin saving for whatever other goals you may have"],"chatgpt_answers":["If you are a beginner investor, it is important to start with a diversified portfolio that is appropriate for your financial situation and goals. Here are some steps you can follow to set up an investment portfolio:Determine your investment goals: What do you want to achieve through your investments? Do you want to save for retirement, for a down payment on a home, or for some other financial goal? Having clear goals will help you make investment decisions that align with your financial plans.Assess your risk tolerance: Different investments carry different levels of risk. It is important to choose investments that are appropriate for your risk tolerance. If you are a more conservative investor, you may want to choose investments with lower levels of risk, such as bonds or funds that invest in blue-chip stocks. If you are a more aggressive investor, you may be willing to accept higher levels of risk in exchange for the potential for higher returns.Determine your asset allocation: Your asset allocation is the mix of different types of assets in your portfolio. A common approach is to allocate a portion of your portfolio to stocks, a portion to bonds, and a portion to cash or other short-term investments. A well-diversified portfolio typically includes a mix of assets across different asset classes, such as domestic and international stocks, different types of bonds (e.g., corporate, government, municipal), and cash or other short-term investments.Choose specific investments: Once you have a sense of your investment goals, risk tolerance, and asset allocation, you can begin choosing specific investments for your portfolio. Some options may include individual stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and index funds.Review and rebalance your portfolio: As your financial situation or goals change, it is important to review and adjust your portfolio as needed. This may involve selling some investments and buying others to maintain your desired asset allocation.I hope this helps!

{"question":"Are variable rate loans ever a good idea?","human_answers":["What's going on here is that the variable rate loan is transferring some of the risk from the bank to you.  In a reasonable deal taking on risk brings with it reward.  It's the same thing as deductibles on insurance--they're transferring some risk to you and thus your expected total cost goes down. Thus the proper evaluation of such deals is whether you can afford the outcome if you draw the short straw.  If you feel you can afford the highest payment that can result then the variable rate is a good deal.  If you're near your limit then stay with the safe option of the fixed rate. For a house this is easy enough to evaluate--run the calculations assuming the highest payment and see what the debt-to-income ratio is.  Note that when we were getting mortgages there was another factor involved: the variable rate loans had a higher initiation cost.  Combined with the very low difference between fixed and ARM rates at the time we went fixed but given the rates you quote going variable would have been a no-brainer for us."],"chatgpt_answers":["Variable rate loans can be a good option for some borrowers, but they may not be the best choice for everyone. It's important to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of a variable rate loan before deciding if it is the right choice for you.One potential benefit of a variable rate loan is that the interest rate may be lower than the interest rate on a fixed rate loan. This can result in lower monthly payments and potentially save you money over the life of the loan. However, it's important to keep in mind that the interest rate on a variable rate loan can also increase over time, which could result in higher monthly payments.If you are considering a variable rate loan, it's a good idea to consider the following factors:Your financial stability: If you have a stable income and a good credit score, you may be better equipped to handle the potential fluctuations in monthly payments that can come with a variable rate loan.Your risk tolerance: If you are comfortable taking on more risk in exchange for the potential for lower payments, a variable rate loan might be a good option for you. However, if you prefer the security of knowing exactly what your monthly payments will be, a fixed rate loan might be a better choice.The terms of the loan: Make sure you understand the terms of the loan, including how often the interest rate can change and what factors can cause the rate to change.

It takes into account the interest rate, any fees or other charges associated with the loan, and the repayment schedule.For a loan that is paid off monthly, the APR is calculated based on the assumption that the loan will be repaid over the course of one year, with equal payments made each month. This means that the APR reflects the total cost of borrowing, including both the interest and any fees or charges, over the entire life of the loan.To calculate the APR for a loan that is paid off monthly, you will need to know the following information:The principal amount of the loan: This is the amount of money that you are borrowing.The interest rate: This is the percentage of the principal that you will be charged as interest on the loan.The repayment term: This is the length of time over which you will be repaying the loan, expressed in months.Any fees or charges associated with the loan: These may include origination fees, closing costs, or other fees that are charged as part of the loan process.To calculate the APR, you can use the following formula:APR = (interest rate\/repayment term) x (365\/number of payments per year) + (fees\/principal) x (365\/number of payments per year)This formula takes into account the interest rate, the repayment term, and any fees or charges associated with the loan, and expresses the total cost of borrowing as a percentage of the principal loan amount.For example, if you are borrowing $10,000 at an interest rate of 6% over a repayment term of 36 months, with a $100 origination fee, the APR would be calculated as follows:APR = (0.06\/36) x (365\/12) + (100\/10000) x (365\/12) = 6.38%This means that the total cost of borrowing the $10,000 over the course of three years, including both the interest and the origination fee, is 6.38% of the principal loan amount."]},
{"question":"Why can't I withdraw the $57 in my account?","human_answers":["Given you mention a check clearing, in addition to debit card holds as JoeTaxpayer notes, you may also have funds that are on hold for that reason.  While the bank may have stated it would be a one day hold, some banks may mean business days (Monday-Friday), and so it will become available on Monday. This is because checks are not always instantly withdrawn from the other account (although this is becoming much more common post-electronic check reform), so the bank wants to make sure it actually is getting the money from the check; after all, if the check you deposited bounces, the bank doesn't want to end up footing the bill.

Even if you cannot, or choose not to, live within bicycle distance of work, you can still reduce your commuting cost by not financing, and by driving a fuel efficient vehicle.

This is where retailers use certain numbers in prices because those prices are more appealing to consumers.  Since stocks - and in your case bitcoin - have prices, they too will be more or less appealing at different prices based on psychology alone."],"chatgpt_answers":["Psychological barriers in the context of marketable securities refer to certain price levels that are believed to have psychological significance for market participants and can influence their trading behavior. These price levels can act as resistance or support for the security's price, meaning that the security may have difficulty breaking through or may be more likely to bounce off of these levels.For example, a security that is trading at a price of $100 may be perceived as having a psychological barrier at the $100 level. If the security's price moves above $100, market participants may be more likely to buy it, believing that the security is undervalued and has room to grow. On the other hand, if the security's price falls below $100, market participants may be more likely to sell it, believing that the security is overvalued and may decline further in value.Psychological barriers can be formed based on a variety of factors, such as round numbers, historical price levels, and market sentiment. They are not necessarily based on any fundamental characteristics of the security itself, but rather reflect the collective psychology of market participants."]},
{"question":"Why don't banks print their own paper money \/ bank notes? ","human_answers":["Actually, banks do issue their own money, it's just not embodied as a piece of paper, it's called checkbook money and in the US, it's backed by 3$ per every 100$ promised, that's the magic of \"fractional reserve banking.\""],"chatgpt_answers":["In most countries, the central bank, not commercial banks, is responsible for printing and issuing paper currency. This is because paper currency is a form of fiat money, which is a type of money that is issued by the government and not backed by a physical commodity such as gold. The government typically grants the central bank a monopoly on the issuance of fiat money, and commercial banks are required to hold reserves of fiat money at the central bank in order to meet the demand for cash from their customers.There are several reasons why central banks, rather than commercial banks, are responsible for issuing paper currency. First, it helps to ensure that there is a stable and trustworthy source of fiat money in circulation. If commercial banks were able to print their own money, it could lead to an increase in the money supply, which could lead to inflation. Second, central banks are typically more financially stable and have better access to resources such as printing technology, making them better equipped to handle the production and distribution of paper currency.In some cases, commercial banks may be allowed to issue their own paper currency, but this is typically only done in limited circumstances and is subject to strict regulations. For example, in the United States, some state-chartered banks are allowed to issue their own bank notes, but these notes must be backed by the bank's assets and are subject to strict security and anti-counterfeiting measures."]},
{"question":"Should I purchase a whole life insurance policy? (I am close to retirement)","human_answers":["Disclaimer: I work in life insurance, but I am not an agent.   First things first, there is not enough information here to give you an answer.  When discussing life insurance, the very first things we need to fully consider are the illustration of policy values, and the contract itself.  Without these, there is no way to tell if this is a good idea or not. So what are the things to look for? A. Risk appetite.  People love to discuss projections of the market, like for example, \"7-8% a year compounded annually\".  Go look at the historical returns of the stock market.  It is never close to that projection.  Life insurance, however, can give you a GUARANTEED return (this would be show in the 'Guaranteed' section of the life insurance illustration).  As long as you pay your premiums, this money is guaranteed to accrue.  Now most life insurance companies also show 'Non-Guaranteed' elements in their illustrations - these are non-guaranteed projections based on a scale at this point in time.  These columns will show how your cash value may grow when dividends are credited to your policy (and used to buy paid-up additional insurance, which generates more dividends - this can be compared to the compounding nature of interest).   B. Tax treatment.  I am definitely not an expert in this area, but life insurance does have preferential tax treatment, particularly to your beneficiaries. C. Beneficiaries.  Any death benefit (again, listed as guaranteed and maybe non-guaranteed values) is generally completely tax free for the beneficiary. D. Strategy.  Tying all of this together, what exactly is the point of this?  To transfer wealth, to accrue wealth, or some combination thereof?  This is important and unstated in your question. So again, without knowing more, there is no way to answer your question.  But I am surprised that in this forum, so many people are quick to jump in and say in general that whole life insurance is a scam.  And even more surprising is the fact the accepted answer has already been accepted. My personal take is that if you are just trying to accrue wealth, you should probably stick to the market and maybe buy term if you want a death benefit component.  This is mostly due to your age (higher risk of death = higher premiums = lower buildup) and how long of a time period you have to build up money in the policy.  But if a 25 year old asked this same question, depending on his purposes, I may suggest that a WL policy is in fact a good idea."],"chatgpt_answers":["It's important to carefully consider your financial needs and goals before deciding whether to purchase a whole life insurance policy. Whole life insurance, also known as permanent life insurance, is a type of policy that provides coverage for your entire life, as long as you continue to pay the premiums. It also includes a savings component, known as the cash value, which can be used as a source of funds for emergencies or other financial needs.If you are close to retirement, you may have different insurance and financial planning needs than someone who is younger. Some considerations to keep in mind when deciding whether a whole life insurance policy is right for you include:Your current and future financial needs: Are you looking for a way to provide financial security for your loved ones after you pass away? Do you have any outstanding debts or other financial obligations that need to be addressed? Answering these questions can help you determine whether a whole life insurance policy is a good fit for your situation.Your current and future financial resources: Do you have other assets, such as a retirement account or savings, that can be used to meet your financial needs and goals? If you have sufficient resources, you may not need the additional protection provided by a whole life insurance policy.Your current and future health status: Life insurance premiums are typically based on your age and overall health, so if you are in good health, you may be able to secure a lower premium on a whole life insurance policy. However, if you have pre-existing health conditions or are at an advanced age, you may be more likely to be denied coverage or face higher premiums.It's a good idea to speak with a financial professional who can help you evaluate your specific situation and determine whether a whole life insurance policy is the right choice for you.

{"question":"If I want a Credit Card offered through a different Credit Union should I slowly transition my banking to that CU?","human_answers":["As has been stated, you don't need to actively bank with a credit union to apply for one of their credit cards. That said, one benefit to having account activity, and significant capital with a CU, is to increase the likelihood of having a larger credit line granted to you, when you do apply. If you are going to use the card sparingly however, then this is a non issue. That said, if you really want to maximize card benefits, then you want to look for cards with large sign up bonuses (e.g. Chase Sapphire, or Ink Bold if you have a business) and sign up exclusively for those bonuses. These cards offer rewards in excessive value of $1000 in travel services (hotels\/plane tickets), or $500 cash back if you prefer straight cash back redemptions. If you prefer to keep it really simple, you can sign up for a cash back card, like the Amex Fidelity, which offers 2% cash back everywhere, with no annual fee (albeit the cash back is through their investment account, which you don't actually have to 'invest' with). Personally, I have the Penfed card, and use it exclusively for gas (5% cash back). I also have a Charles Schwab bank account, which I keep funded exclusively for ATM withdrawals (free ATM usage, worldwide, 100% fee reimbursement).

This will allow you to deposit your paychecks and pay bills directly from the account.Set up automatic payments: Consider setting up automatic payments for your bills, such as your rent or mortgage, utilities, and other recurring expenses. This will help ensure that you don't miss any payments while you are transitioning your banking.Transfer your direct deposit: If you receive your paycheck via direct deposit, ask your employer to redirect your deposit to your new credit union account.Close your old accounts: Once you feel comfortable using your new credit union account and have transferred all of your automatic payments and direct deposits, you can close your old accounts.

{"question":"What are some signs that the stock market might crash? ","human_answers":["There are some economic signs as there are in all economic and business cycles, such as interest rates rising. However, a more effective way is to actually look at price action itself. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs followed by higher lows. The definition of a downtrend is lower lows followed by lower highs. So if you are looking to invest for the long term you can look at the weekly or even the monthly chart of the market say over the past 10, 15 or 20 years. Using these definitions on say the S&P500 if the price continues to make higher highs and higher lows then stay in the market. If the price makes a lower high than the previous high, then this is a warning sign that the trend may be about to end. The trend has not broken yet but it is a warning sign that it could be ending soon. If the price makes a higher low next followed by a higher high, then the trend continues and you just need to keep an eye on things. If, however, the price makes a lower low after the lower high this is a signal that the uptrend is over and you should get out of the market. If the price makes a lower low directly after a higher high, then be cautious and wait for confirmation that the uptrend is over. If you then get a lower high this is confirmation that the uptrend is over, you would then sell if prices drop below the previous low. If you invest in individual shares then you should keep an eye on the charts for the index and individual shares as well. The index chart will give you an indication if the uptrend is over for the whole market, then you can be more cautious in regards to the individual shares. You can then plan exit points on each individual share if their trends are broken too. If you have stop losses employed and the trend reverses on the index, this would be a good time to tighten your stop losses on individual shares. You can then buy back into the market when you determine that the downtrend is broken and prices start to show higher highs and higher lows again. Will there be occasions when the uptrend reverses and then after a short period starts trending up again, yes there might be, but the worse that will happen is that you pay a bit of extra brokerage to get out and then back into the market, and you might have to pay some capital gains tax on any profits made. But remember no one ever went broke making a profit. The most important thing to remember when investing is to conserve and protect your capital. I would rather pay some extra brokerage and some capital gains tax than see my portfolio drop by 50% or more, then take 5 years or more to recover. And remember, paying tax is a good thing, it means you made money. If you don't want to pay any tax it means you will never make any profits, because if you make profits you will have to pay tax one day."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are no sure signs that a stock market crash is imminent.

{"question":"Why do interest rates increase or decrease?","human_answers":["Fundamentally interest rates reflect the time preference people place on money and the things money can buy.  If I have a high time preference then I prefer money in my hand versus money promised to me at some date in the future.  Thus, I will only loan my money to someone if they offer me an incentive which would be an amount of money to be received in the future that is larger than the amount of money I\u2019m giving the debtor in the present (i.e. the interest rate). Many factors go into my time preference determination.  My demand for cash (i.e. my cash balance), the credit rating of the borrower, the length of the loan, and my expectation of the change in currency value are just a few of the factors that affect what interest rate I will loan money. The first loan I make will have a lower interest rate than the last loan, ceteris paribus.  This is because my supply of cash diminishes with each loan which makes my remaining cash more valuable and a higher interest rate will be needed to entice me to make additional loans.  This is the theory behind why interest rates will rise when QE3 or QEinfinity ever stops.  QE is where the Federal Reserve cartel prints new money to purchase bonds from cartel banks.  If QE slows or ends the supply of money will stop increasing which will make cash more valuable and higher interest rates will be needed to entice creditors to loan money. Note that increasing the stock of money does not necessarily result in lower interest rates.  As stated earlier, the change in value of the currency also affects the interest rate lenders are willing to accept.  If the Federal Reserve cartel deposited $1 million everyday into every US citizen\u2019s bank account it wouldn\u2019t take long before lenders demanded very high interest rates as compensation for the decrease in the value of the currency. Does the Federal Reserve cartel affect interest rates?  Yes, in two ways.  First, as mentioned before, it prints new money that is loaned to the government.  It either purchases the bonds directly or purchases the bonds from cartel banks which give them cash to purchase more government bonds.  This keeps demand high for government bonds which lowers the yield on government bonds (yields move inverse to the price of the bond).  The Federal Reserve cartel also can provide an unlimited amount of funds at the Federal Funds rate to the cartel member banks.  Banks can borrow at this rate and then proceed to make loans at a higher rate and pocket the difference. Remember, however, that the Federal Reserve cartel is not the only market participant.  Other bond holders, such as foreign governments and pension funds, buy and sell US bonds.  At some point they could demand higher rates.  The Federal Reserve cartel, which currently holds close to 17% of US public debt, could attempt to keep rates low by printing new money to buy all existing US bonds to prevent the yield on bonds from going up.  At that point, however, holding US dollars becomes very dangerous as it is apparent the Federal Reserve cartel is just a money printing machine for the US government.  That\u2019s when most people begin to dump dollars en masse."],"chatgpt_answers":["Interest rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, the supply and demand for credit, and the level of inflation in an economy.In general, when the economy is strong and growing, demand for credit (e.g., loans to buy homes, cars, etc.) tends to be high, which can lead to higher interest rates as lenders try to compensate for the increased risk of lending money. On the other hand, when the economy is weak and there is less demand for credit, interest rates may be lower as lenders try to encourage borrowing and stimulate economic activity.Inflation, or the general increase in prices over time, can also affect interest rates. If the rate of inflation is high, the central bank (such as the Federal Reserve in the United States) may choose to raise interest rates in order to reduce the supply of money in circulation and help curb inflation. Conversely, if the rate of inflation is low, the central bank may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and stimulate economic growth.There are many other factors that can influence interest rates as well, such as the stability of the financial system, the level of government debt, and the overall level of risk in the economy."]},

Would'nt that be a kind of personal benefit for you ?"],"chatgpt_answers":["There can be a financial benefit for buyers to use community currencies in certain circumstances. Community currencies are alternative forms of money that are issued and used within a specific community or region. They are often designed to promote local economic development and to encourage the use of locally-owned businesses.One potential financial benefit of using community currencies is that they can help to stimulate local economic activity. When people use community currencies to purchase goods and services from local businesses, it can help to keep money circulating within the community and support the local economy. This can, in turn, create jobs and increase the prosperity of the community.Additionally, community currencies may offer other financial benefits to buyers. For example, they may be accepted at a discount by local businesses, or they may be available at a lower exchange rate than the national currency, which can make purchases more affordable for the buyer.It is important to note that the financial benefits of using community currencies may vary depending on the specific community currency and the local economic conditions. It is always a good idea to carefully consider the pros and cons of using any alternative currency before making a decision."]},
{"question":"Is UK house price spiral connected to debt based monetary system? ","human_answers":["No. Rural Scotland has exactly the same monetary system, and not the same bubble. Monaco (the other example given) doesn't even have its own monetary system but uses the Euro. Look instead to the common factor: a lot of demand for limited real estate. Turning towards the personal finance part of it, we know from experience that housing bubbles may \"burst\" and housing prices may drop suddenly by ~30%, sometimes more. This is a financial risk if you must sell. Yet on the other hand, the fundamental force that keeps prices in London higher than average isn't going away. The long-term risk often is manageable. A 30% drop isn't so bad if you own a house for 30 years."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is possible that the debt-based monetary system may have contributed to the increase in house prices in the UK. In a debt-based monetary system, the supply of money is largely determined by the amount of debt that is issued. This can lead to an expansion of the money supply, which can in turn contribute to inflation and higher asset prices, such as real estate.There are also other factors that can contribute to rising house prices, such as low interest rates, population growth, and demand for housing outpacing the supply of available properties.It is important to note that the relationship between the debt-based monetary system and house prices is complex and multifaceted, and there are likely to be a variety of factors contributing to any changes in the housing market."]},

{"question":"Difference between Edward Jones or Betterment ","human_answers":["Instead of saying which one is better, which is too subjective, I think it is more important to understand what these institutions are.  They are kind of different animals. Edward Jones pretty much a full service wealth manager.  They meet with you in person, advise you on what retirement and savings accounts to get, they talk to you to evaluate your risk preferences.  They will talk to you about planning for your kids' college and about your insurance situation. They will probably attend your kids' bar mitzvahs and stuff too.  Of course, this isn't free.  With Edward Jones you will pay a fixed percentage of your managed wealth to them every year.  And they will likely put your money in expensive mutual funds.  And those mutual funds will charge a special 12b-1 fee, which is a kickback to the wealth manager.  Plan on giving 2% or so of your total wealth to the manager per year, plus whatever the mutual funds charge.   I don't have experience with Betterment, but they appear to be a robo advisor.  Robo advisors attempt to do the same kinds of things as wealth managers, but rely on computer algorithms and web pages to give you advice whenever possible.  This makes some sense because most people aren't actually that special in terms of their financial situation.  I don't know their cost structure, but presumably it will be significantly cheaper than Edward Jones.  They will almost certainly put you in cheaper funds (index funds and ETF's).  Think of it as a cost-conscious alternative to Edward Jones. Vanguard is a discount broker and a mutual fund family.  Their funds are among the biggest and cheapest in the world.  Fees on many of these funds will be a fraction of the equivalent funds Edward Jones will put you in.  They will charge you nothing at all to manage your money.  They will give you some assistance and advice if you call them but don't expect any house calls.  They aren't particularly in the business of giving advice.  If you know what you want to invest in, this is the cheapest way to do it by far.  Basically you won't have to pay anything at all except the actual cost of the assets you are investing in. Which is the best?  Depends on your own preferences and ability.  If you do not want to learn about personal finance and don't particularly care about whether you are getting the best return--if you don't mind paying for a personal touch--Edward Jones might be a good choice.  For most people who are comfortable asking this type of question online and interested in learning about finance even a little bit, I'd expect that Betterment or Vanguard will be a better choice.  For people who are willing to learn a bit of finance and manage their own affairs, using Vanguard (or a close competitor, like Fidelity) will ultimately result in the most wealth generated (the least given away to the financial industry)."],"chatgpt_answers":["Edward Jones and Betterment are two different financial services companies that offer different types of products and services.Edward Jones is a full-service brokerage firm that provides financial advice and sells a wide range of financial products, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and insurance.

This means that if you fail to make the payments on the loan, the lender can go after the co-signer for the unpaid balance.As a result, the co-signer's credit will be affected by the loan.

The answer by @littleadv covers the tax complications.  I do have one additional point. The sale can't be a short sale. The bank will never approve. The short sale can only be approved when the bank is convinced that there are no viable purchasers at a level to get all their money back. Your sibling is not an arms length transaction."],"chatgpt_answers":["If you sell a property for less than its appraised value, the difference between the sale price and the appraised value is considered a gift. If the sale price is less than the appraised value and the buyer is a family member, the difference is considered a gift to the family member.Gifts to family members are generally not taxable, but there are limits on the amount of gifts you can give without incurring gift tax. The current gift tax exclusion is $15,000 per recipient per year. This means you can give up to $15,000 per year to each individual recipient without incurring gift tax. If you give more than $15,000 to a single recipient in a single year, you will need to file a gift tax return (Form 709) and pay gift tax on the excess amount. However, if the total value of all gifts you give during your lifetime is less than the lifetime gift tax exclusion amount ($11.7 million in 2021), you will not have to pay any gift tax.It's important to note that while the sale of a property to a family member for less than its appraised value is not taxable as a gift, it may still have tax consequences if the property was originally purchased for a price that was different from the sale price. If the property was sold for more than the original purchase price, you may owe capital gains tax on the difference. If the property was sold for less than the original purchase price, you may be able to claim a loss on your tax return.It's also important to consider the potential impact of the sale on the buyer's finances, including any financing or mortgage issues that may arise as a result of the sale price being less than the appraised value.

{"question":"What is the true value, i.e. advantages or benefits, of building up equity in your home?","human_answers":["The equity you have is an asset. Locked away until you sell, and sometimes pledged as a loan if you wish. The idea that it's dead money is nonsense, it's a pretty illiquid asset that has the potential for growth (at the rate of inflation or slightly higher, long term) and provides you an annual dividend in the form of free rent.  In this country, most people who own homes have a disproportionate amount of their wealth in their house. This is more a testament to the poor saving rate than anything else. For me, a high equity position means that I can sell my home and buy a lesser sized house for cash. I am older and my own goal (with the mrs) is to have the house paid and college for the kid fully funded before we think of retiring. For others, it's cash they can use to rent after they retire.

Building up equity in your home can have several advantages:It can act as a financial cushion: Having a significant amount of equity in your home can provide financial security and give you a sense of financial stability. If you face an unexpected financial hardship or need to make a major purchase, you may be able to tap into your home equity through a home equity loan or a cash-out refinance.It can increase the value of your home: As you pay off your mortgage and build up equity in your home, the value of your home may increase. This can be especially beneficial if you decide to sell your home in the future, as you may be able to sell it for more than you paid for it.It can lower your monthly mortgage payments: As you pay down your mortgage and build up equity in your home, the amount of your mortgage that is based on the unpaid principal balance will decrease. This can lead to a lower monthly mortgage payment.It can make it easier to refinance: If you have a significant amount of equity in your home, it may be easier to qualify for a lower interest rate when you refinance your mortgage.

{"question":"Can I add PMI to my principal balance when I take out a mortgage?","human_answers":["There are few different types of MI you can choose from, they are: Borrower-Paid Monthly (this is what most people think of when they think MI) Borrower-Paid Single Premium (you may have QM issues on this) Lender Paid Single Premium Split Up-front and Monthly The only way to determine which option will ultimately cost you less is to come up with a time estimate or range for how long you anticipate you will hold this mortgage, then look at each option over that time, and see where they fall. To answer your question about the single-premium being added to your loan, this typically does not happen (outside of FHA\/VA).  The reason for that is you would now have 90%+ financing and fall into a new pricing bracket, if not being disqualified altogether.  What is far more typical is the use of premium pricing to pay this up-front premium.  Premium pricing is where you take a lender credit in exchange for an elevated rate; it is the exact opposite of paying points to buy down your rate. For example:  say a zero point rate is 4.25%, and you have monthly MI of say .8%.  Your effective rate would be 5.05%.  It may be possible to use premium pricing at an elevated rate of say 4.75% to pay your MI up front--now your effective rate is the note rate of 4.75%.  This is how a single premium can save you money.  Keep in mind though, the 4.75% will be your rate for the life of the loan, and in the other scenario, once the MI drops off, the effective rate will go back down from 5.05% to 4.25%.

{"question":"Optimal Asset Allocation","human_answers":["When you have multiple assets available and a risk-free asset (cash or borrowing) you will always end up blending them if you have a reasonable objective function.  However, you seem to have constrained yourself to 100% investment.  Combine that with the fact that you are considering only two assets and you can easily have a solution where only one asset is desired in the portfolio.  The fact that you describe the US fund as \"dominating\" the forign fund indicates that this may be the case for you.  Ordinarily diversification benefits the overall portfolio even if one asset \"dominates\" another but it may not in your special case. Notice that these funds are both already highly diversified, so all you are getting is cross-border diversification by getting more than one.  That may be why you are getting the solution you are.  I've seen a lot of suggested allocations that have weights similar to what you are using. Finding an optimal portfolio given a vector of expected returns and a covariance matrix is very easy, with some reliable results.  Fancy models get pretty much the same kinds of answers as simple ones.  However, getting a good covariance matrix is hard and getting a good expected return vector is all but impossible.  Unfortunately portfolio results are very sensitive to these inputs.  For that reason, most of us use portfolio theory to guide our intuition, but seldom do the math for our own portfolio.  In any model you use, your weak link is the expected return and covariance.  More sophisticated models don't usually help produce a more reasonable result.

The goal of asset allocation is to diversify your investments in a way that balances risk and reward, based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.There is no one-size-fits-all approach to asset allocation, as the optimal mix of assets will depend on your individual circumstances. Some factors to consider when determining your asset allocation include your age, time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial goals.For example, younger investors who have a longer time horizon may be able to take on more risk in their portfolio, as they have more time to recover from market fluctuations. As such, they may choose to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to stocks, which have the potential for higher returns but also come with more volatility.On the other hand, older investors or those who are nearing retirement may have a lower risk tolerance and may want to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to more stable investments, such as bonds or cash.It is important to periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure that it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

This can be useful if you want to share the responsibility for managing your finances with a partner, family member, or friend, or if you simply want to have an extra layer of accountability.It's important to note that each of these apps has its own set of features and limitations, so you'll want to carefully review the options and choose one that meets your specific needs. Some things to consider include the type of accounts you want to track (e.g., checking, savings, credit cards), whether you need to be able to set and track budgets, and whether you want to be able to see and analyze your investment portfolio.It's also a good idea to read reviews and do some research to make sure the app you choose is reliable and has good customer support. This will help ensure that you have a positive experience using the app and can get help if you run into any issues."]},
{"question":"How much of my home loan is coming from a bank, how much it goes back? ","human_answers":["Ditto mhoran_psprep.  I'm not quite sure what you're asking. Where does the money come from? When someone starts a bank, they normally get together a bunch of investors -- perhaps people they know personally, perhaps they sell stock -- to raise initial capital. But most of the money in the bank comes from depositors. Fundamentally, what a bank does is take money from depositors and loan it to borrowers. (Banks also borrow money from other banks and from the government.) They charge the borrowers interest on the loan, and they pay depositors interest on their deposits. The difference between those two interest rates is where the bank gets their profit. Where does the money go when you pay it back? As mhoran_psprep said, some of it goes to pay interest to the depositors; some of it goes to pay the bank's expenses like employee salaries, cost of the building, etc; and some of it goes as profit to the owners or stockholders of the bank. If you're thinking, \"Wow, I'm paying back a whole lot more than I borrowed\", well, yes. But remember you're borrowing that money for 20 or 30 years. The bank isn't making very much money on the loan each year that you have it -- these days something like 4 or 5% in the U.S., I don't know what the going rates are in other countries."],"chatgpt_answers":["When you take out a home loan, the lender (usually a bank) provides you with a certain amount of money to finance the purchase of your home. This amount is typically referred to as the principal of the loan. The principal is the amount of money that you borrow, and it is the main component of your monthly mortgage payments.As you make monthly payments on your mortgage, a portion of each payment goes towards paying off the principal of the loan, while the rest goes towards paying interest. The interest is the fee that the lender charges for borrowing the money. The amount of each payment that goes towards paying off the principal and the amount that goes towards paying interest can vary, depending on the terms of your mortgage.To determine how much of your home loan is coming from the bank and how much is going back, you will need to know the terms of your mortgage, including the interest rate, the length of the loan, and the amount of your monthly payments.

{"question":"I'm upside down on my car loan and need a different car, what can I do?","human_answers":["Before buying a new car, determine whether you really need one! If there's an automotive discussion, you should ask there FIRST to get opinions on how much all-wheel-drive helps. You may not want to change cars at all. Remember, most of us in the Northeast are NOT driving all-wheel-drive vehicles, and all cars have all-wheel brakes. All-wheel drive is better at getting you moving from a stop if one of the drive wheels would otherwise be slipping. It makes less difference during actual driving.  Traction control braking is much more important -- and much more common, hence much cheaper. And probably already present in your Camry. And good tires make a huge difference. (Top-of-the-line all-season tires are adequate, but many folks do switch to snow tires during the winter and switch back again in summer.)  Tires -- even if you get a second set of rims to put them on -- are a heck of a lot cheaper than changing cars. Beyond everything else, driving in winter conditions is a matter of careful practice. Most of the time, simply avoiding making sudden starts\/stops\/turns and not driving like you're in a video arcade (\"gotta pass three more or I lose my game!\") will do the job. You'll learn the feel of how the car responds. Some basic instruction in how to handle a skid will prepare you for the relatively rare times when that happens. (Some folks actively learn by practicing skids in a nice open parking lot if they can find one; I never have but it makes some sense.) If in doubt about the driving conditions, wait until the roads have been plowed and salted.

This can be a difficult financial situation to be in, but there are a few options that you can consider:Trade in your current car for a less expensive model: If you are able to find a buyer for your current car, you may be able to trade it in for a less expensive model and use the equity from the sale to help pay off some of the remaining balance on your loan.Sell your car and use the proceeds to pay off the loan: If you are able to sell your car for more than you owe on the loan, you can use the proceeds from the sale to pay off the remaining balance and use the remainder to put toward a new car.Roll the remaining balance into a new loan: If you are unable to sell your car or trade it in, you may be able to roll the remaining balance on your current loan into a new loan for a different car. This will allow you to pay off the old loan and start a new one with a new car.

{"question":"Why do gas stations charge different amounts in the same local area?","human_answers":["I'll echo: many factors. Brand: There are generally two levels of pricing: \"major brand\" and \"discount brand\". You can generally expect the \"discount brand\" to cost about 5-10 cents less per gallon in the same neighborhood as \"major brand\" gas. This is for a number of sub-factors; chief among them is that not all gasolines are created equal. A lot of the major brands (Shell, Texaco, Chevron, BP, Exxon) have proprietary detergents and cleaning agents that the discount brands do not. They're also generally closer to the real octane rating of the gas, have less ethanol (you'll see the sign that says \"contains up to 10% ethanol\"; the bargain brands are right up at that limit while the top-tier brands keep it lower) and have stricter requirements about storage tank maintenance. Anyone who tells you that all gas is the same, send em my way; I tried to save a few bux buying the cheaper stuff and now my car needs an engine overhaul because of fouling causing premature wear. A couple of my co-workers got a fuel system overhaul free from the local supermarket because the storage tank wasn't properly purged, and they got water into their gas tanks. Market Price: Yes, this is of course a factor. Generally, gas prices at the pump rise very quickly when the market price of crude or gasoline goes up, then fall more slowly than the market price, because the margins on gas sales for a C-store are very slim. When prices change, the C-stores lose either way; when prices rise they have to pay more than they got from the last tankful to buy the next one, and when prices fall they don't recoup the cost of their current tank. By quickly increasing the price to match commodities market prices, then gradually lowering them over time even if the market collapses, they mitigate the losses both ways. Overhead: A gas station right next to a highway probably had to pay more for that land, both to buy\/lease it and in property taxes. Nicer (newer, cleaner) stations generally have to pay more to stay that way. The higher your operating costs, the more you'll have to charge for your gas. You can usually do so because the nicer station will attract customers willing to pay a few cents more for the nicer facilities. Taxation: Most States charge a tax on gasoline, in addition to a Federal tax on gas. That revenue either goes into the State's general fund, or is earmarked for transportation costs like road maintenance. California's gas prices are sky-high across the state, because they have the highest gas tax. I'm not sure Colorado, Wyoming and Montana have gas taxes at all. Proximity to other stations: No matter what you have to pay for the land and facilities, if there's another station across the street, you have to be within a penny of their price or people will vote with their feet. While \"predatory pricing\" (taking a loss on sales in one area, buffered by profits elsewhere, in order to drive out competition) is technically illegal, you see it all the time in the C-store industry and it is very difficult to prove. This is a primary cause of neighborhood-to-neighborhood changes; a C-store will look around the other stations on their street corner, and the ones down the road a block or two each direction, when determining what they can sell gas for that day. The guy five blocks down has a completely different pool of competing stations. Population Distribution: With a lot of people in a particular area, there's a big \"pie\" of customer dollars for C-stores to compete for. This generally leads to increased prices because the stations don't have to be AS cutthroat; regardless of how good your price is, you have only so many pumps, and at some point people will pay more to use the open pump than wait for the cheaper one. The reverse is true in rural areas; with only two stations in an entire small town, those two stations will become extremely cutthroat. However, rural prices also vary more; with only one station in easy walking distance from where you ran out of gas, they can charge you $6 to fill that gallon gas can if they want, and you'll pay it because the next gas station's another 20 miles down the road and probably has even higher prices. This, along with overhead, is generally why the Rockies states have the lowest average prices; land's cheap and people are scarce in Wyoming. But, the \"price-gouging\" can be seen in the rural Southwest, where there's a LOT of ground to cover between gas stations, and so the \"last chance gas\" along major highways just outside of town, each a nickel to a dime more than the previous station, is a common stereotype. Transportation costs: Prices are higher on the East and West Coasts than in the Gulf States for a very simple reason; the bulk of the U.S. refinery capacity is along the Gulf Coast between Galveston and the Florida border. The further you are from there, the more it costs to get the fuel from the refinery to the gas station, and that cost is reflected at the pump. In fact, the East Coast imports gasoline by tanker even though the United States is now a net exporter of gasoline, because it's cheaper to buy it from foreign sources than it would be to watch it drip through the limited pipeline capacity that exists between the Gulf states and the Eastern Seaboard."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a number of factors that can contribute to the price differences you may see among gas stations in the same local area. Some of the most common reasons include:Competition: Gas stations often adjust their prices based on the competition in their local area. If there are a number of gas stations in close proximity to one another, they may all be competing for the same customers and may adjust their prices accordingly.Location: Gas stations that are located in areas with higher demand, such as near a highway or in a densely populated city, may be able to charge higher prices because there is more demand for their products.Cost of transportation: Gas stations that are located farther from the source of their fuel may incur higher transportation costs, which may be reflected in the price of their gasoline.Brand reputation: Some gas stations are associated with a particular brand or chain, and these brands may have different pricing strategies or pricing agreements with their suppliers.Quality of gasoline: Some gas stations offer higher-quality gasoline that may be more expensive to produce, but that may also be more attractive to customers who are willing to pay a premium for a higher-quality product.Taxes: Gasoline prices can also be affected by the taxes that are applied to them by local, state, and federal governments. These taxes may vary depending on the location of the gas station."]},
{"question":"Definition of gross income (Arizona state tax filing requirements)","human_answers":["Many states have a simple method for assessing income tax on nonresidents.  If you have $X income in State A where you claim nonresident status and  $Y income overall, then you owe State A a fraction (X\/Y) of the income  tax that would have been due on $Y income had you been a resident of State A.  In other words, compute the state income tax on $Y as per State A rules, and send us (X\/Y) of that amount.  If you are a resident of State B, then State B  will tax you on $Y but give you some credit for taxes paid to State A. Thus, you might be required to file a State A income tax return regardless of how small $X is.  As a practical matter, many commercial real-estate  investments are set up as limited partnerships in which most of the annual taxable income is a small amount of portfolio income (usually interest income that you report on Schedule B of Form 1040), and the annual  bottom line is lots of passive losses which the limited partners report (but do not get to deduct) on the Federal return.  As a result, State A is unlikely to come after you for the tax on, say, $100 of interest income each year because it will cost them more to go after you than they will  recover from you. But, when the real estate is sold, there will (hopefully) be a big capital gain, most of which  will be sheltered from Federal tax since the passive losses finally get  to be deducted.  At this point, State A is not only owed a lot of money (it knows nothing of your passive losses etc) but, after it processes the income tax return that you filed for that year, it will likely demand that you file income tax returns for previous years as well."],"chatgpt_answers":["In Arizona, gross income refers to all income received or earned during the taxable year, before any deductions or exemptions have been taken.

{"question":"What forces cause a company to write down goodwill?","human_answers":["To understand the answer we first have to understand what Goodwill is. Goodwill in a companies balance sheet is an intangible asset that represents the extra value because of a strong brand name, good customer relations, good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology.

Goodwill and other intangibles on the books of   companies in the S&P 500 are valued at $2.6 trillion, or 10% of their   total assets, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. As the economy deteriorates and more firms trade down towards (or even   below) their book value, empire-builders are having to mark down the   value of assets they splashed out on in rosier times. A recently   announced $25 billion goodwill charge is expected to push Time Warner   into an operating loss for 2008, for instance. Michael Moran of   Goldman Sachs thinks such hits could amount to $200 billion or more   over the cycle. Investors have so far paid little attention to   intangibles, but as write-downs proliferate they are likely to become   increasingly wary of industries with a high ratio of goodwill to   assets, such as health care, consumer goods and telecoms. How bad things get will depend on the beancounters. American firms   used to be allowed to amortise goodwill over many years. Since 2002,   when an accounting-rule change ended that practice, goodwill has had   to be tested every year for impairment. In this stormy environment,   with auditors keener than ever to avoid being seen to go easy on   clients, companies are being told to mark down assets if there is any   doubt about their value. The sanguine point out that this has no effect on cashflow, since such   charges are non-cash items. Moreover, some investors take goodwill   write-offs with a pinch of salt, preferring to look past such   non-recurring costs and accept the higher \u201cnormalised\u201d earnings   numbers to which managers understandably cling. The largest companies   are thus able to survive thumping blows that might otherwise floor   them, such as the $99 billion loss that the newly formed but   ill-conceived AOL Time Warner, as it then was, reported for 2002. But   the impact can be all too real, as write-downs reduce overall book   value and increase leverage ratios, a particular concern in these   debt-averse times."],"chatgpt_answers":["Goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the excess of the purchase price of a company over the fair market value of its tangible assets and liabilities. It is typically recorded on the balance sheet when a company acquires another company at a price that is higher than the fair market value of its net tangible assets.There are several forces that can cause a company to write down goodwill, including:Impairment: If the fair market value of a company's assets and liabilities decreases significantly, the company may need to write down the value of its goodwill. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as changes in market conditions, changes in the industry in which the company operates, or changes in the company's financial performance.Restructuring: If a company undergoes a restructuring, such as a divestiture or a merger, it may need to write down the value of its goodwill if the restructuring results in a significant change in the fair market value of the company's assets and liabilities.Reassessment: Companies are required to reassess the value of their goodwill on an annual basis to ensure that it is still accurate. If the value of the goodwill has changed, the company may need to write it down.Changes in accounting standards: Changes in accounting standards may also require companies to write down the value of their goodwill. For example, the adoption of new accounting standards may require companies to use different methods to value their goodwill, which could result in a write-down."]},

{"question":"What factors you have do you count on to speculate effectively?","human_answers":["Strategy would be my top factor.  While this may be implied, I do think it helps to have an idea of what is causing the buy and sell signals in speculating as I'd rather follow a strategy than try to figure things out completely from scratch that doesn't quite make sense to me. There are generally a couple of different schools of analysis that may be worth passing along: Fundamental Analysis:Fundamental analysis of a business involves analyzing its financial statements and health, its management and competitive advantages, and its competitors and markets. When applied to futures and forex, it focuses on the overall state of the economy, interest rates, production, earnings, and management. When analyzing a stock, futures contract, or currency using fundamental analysis there are two basic approaches one can use; bottom up analysis and top down analysis. The term is used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis, such as quantitative analysis and technical analysis. Technical Analysis:In finance, technical analysis is a security analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis, which, being an aspect of active management, stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable. There are tools like \"Stock Screeners\" that will let you filter based on various criteria to use each analysis in a mix.  There are various strategies one could use.  Wikipedia under Stock Speculator lists: \"Several different types of stock trading strategies or approaches exist including day trading, trend following, market making, scalping (trading), momentum trading, trading the news, and arbitrage.\"  Thus, I'd advise research what approach are you wanting to use as the \"Make it up as we go along losing real money all the way\" wouldn't be my suggested approach.

{"question":"Remote jobs and incidental wage costs: What do I have to consider?","human_answers":["An employee costs the company in four ways: Salary, taxes, benefits, and capital. Salary: The obvious one, what they pay you. Taxes: There are several taxes that an employer has to pay for the privilege of hiring someone, including social security taxes (which goes to your retirement), unemployment insurance tax (your unemployment benefits if they lay you off), and workers compensation tax (pays if you are injured on the job). (There may be other taxes that I'm not thinking of, but in any case those are the main ones.) Benefits: In the U.S. employers often pay for medical insurance, sometimes for dental, life, and disability. There's usually some sort of retirement plan. They expect to give you some number of vacation days, holidays, and sick days where they pay you even though you're not working. Companies sometimes offer other benefits, like discounts on buying company products, membership in health clubs, etc. Capital: Often the company has to provide you with some sort of equipment, like a computer; furniture, like a chair and desk; etc. As far as the company is concerned, all of the above are part of the cost of having you as an employee. If they would pay a domestic employee $60,000 in salary and $20,000 in taxes, then assuming the same benefits and capital investment, if a foreign employee would cost them $0 in taxes they should logically be willing to pay $80,000. Any big company will have accountants who figure out the total cost of a new employee in excruciating detail, and they will likely be totally rational about this. A smaller company might think, \"well, taxes don't really count ...\" This is irrational but people are not always rational. I don't know what benefits they are offering you, if any, and what equipment they will provide you with, if any.  I also don't know what taxes, if any, a U.S. company has to pay when hiring a remote employee in a foreign country. If anybody on here knows the answer to that, please chime in. Balanced against that, the company likely sees disadvantages to hiring a foreign remote employee, too. Communication will be more difficult, which may result in inefficiency. My previous employer used some contractors in India and while there were certainly advantages, the language and time zone issues caused difficulties. There are almost certainly some international bureaucratic inconveniences they will have to deal with. Etc. So while you should certainly calculate what it would cost them to have a domestic employee doing the same job, that's not necessarily the end of the story. And ultimately it all comes down to negotiations. Even if the company knows that by the time they add in taxes and benefits and whatever, a domestic employee will cost them $100,000 a year, if they are absolutely convinced that they should be able to hire an Austrian for $60,000 a year, that might be the best offer you will get. You can point out the cost savings, and maybe they will concede the point and maybe not."],"chatgpt_answers":["If you are an employer and you have employees who work remotely, you may need to consider certain incidental expenses that they incur as a result of working from home.

However, there are a few things you should consider when determining how to handle incidental wage costs for remote workers:Tax implications: Reimbursing employees for incidental expenses may be considered taxable income, so you should consult with a tax professional to understand the tax implications for your business.Fairness: It's important to ensure that the amount you reimburse your employees for incidental expenses is fair and reasonable. This may involve researching the typical costs associated with working from home in the employee's location and ensuring that the reimbursement covers those costs.Record-keeping: You should have a system in place for tracking and documenting the incidental expenses that your employees incur, as well as any reimbursements you provide. This will help ensure that you are accurately tracking the costs associated with your remote workforce and can provide documentation if necessary.Employee satisfaction: Providing support for incidental expenses can help improve the satisfaction and productivity of your remote workers, as it shows that you are invested in their success and are willing to invest in the tools and resources they need to do their job effectively."]},
{"question":"What are the key facts to research before buying shares of a company?","human_answers":["I have my \"safe\" money in index funds but like to dabble in individual stocks.

For SBUX, my decision process literally started inside a store: \"Rocky, why are you standing in line to overpay for coffee? Wow, look at all these people! Hmmm. I wonder if this is a good stock to buy?\" Check out their fundamentals. Are they profitable? P.E.ratio, book value, and PEG are helpful, and I tend to use them as a gauge for whether I think the stock is overpriced or not. I compare those values to others in the industry. SBUX right now has a PE of ~30, which looks about average for its peers (PEP, KKD, GMCR). So far so good. Does it pay a dividend? This isn't necessarily good or bad, just useful to know. I like dividend-paying stocks, even if it means the stock price might not grow as aggressively. Also, a company that pays a dividend is naturally confident in its ability to turn a profit and generate cash. So it's a safer pick, in my opinion. SBUX pays a dividend, a small one, but that's a plus for me. Am I willing to watch the stock? With my index funds, I buy and forget. With my stocks, I keep an eye on the situation, read the news, and have to make a buy\/sell decision regularly. With SBUX, I don't watch all that closely, I just keep up with the news.

I've developed two very important rules from this study: If you follow these two rules you will be able to weather almost any governmental or banking crisis."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a few strategies you can consider to protect your savings from exceptional taxes:Diversify your savings: Consider spreading your savings across multiple accounts and types of investments, such as a high-yield savings account, a money market fund, and a CD ladder. This can help to reduce the impact of any potential taxes on your savings.Contribute to a retirement account: Contributions to certain types of retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, may be tax-deductible or tax-deferred, which can help to reduce the overall tax burden on your savings.Keep good records: Make sure you keep good records of your savings and investments, including any tax-advantaged accounts. This can help you to more easily track and report any taxes owed on your savings.Consult with a financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you to create a savings plan that takes into account your specific financial goals and situation, and can offer guidance on how to minimize the impact of taxes on your savings.It's important to note that the specific tax implications of your savings will depend on the laws in your jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of your financial situation.

{"question":"How do I get into investing?","human_answers":["Don't do it until you have educated yourself enough to know what you are doing. I hope you won't take this personally, but given that you are wandering around asking random strangers on the Internet how to \"get into investing,\" I feel safe in concluding that you are by no means a sophisticated enough investor to be choosing individual investments, nor should you be trusting financial advisors to choose investments for you. Believe me, they do not have your interests at heart. I usually advise people in your position to start by reading one book: A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel. Once you've read the book by Malkiel you'll understand that the best strategy for all but the most sophisticated investors is to buy an index fund, which simply purchases a portfolio of ALL available stocks without trying to pick winners and losers. The best index funds are at Vanguard (there is also a Vanguard site for non-US residents). Vanguard is one of the very, very, very few honest players in the business. Unlike almost any other mutual fund, Vanguard is owned by its investors, so it has no profit motive. They never try to pick individual stocks, so they don't have to pay fancy high-priced analysts to pick stocks. If you find it impossible to open a Vanguard account from wherever you're living, find a local brokerage account that will allow you to invest in the US stock market. Many Vanguard mutual funds are available as ETFs which means that you buy and sell them just like any other stock on the US market, which should be easy to do from any reasonably civilized place."],"chatgpt_answers":["Investing can be a good way to potentially earn money and grow your wealth over time.

{"question":"Why can low volume move a stock price drastically?","human_answers":["In a sense, yes. There's a view in Yahoo Finance that looks like this   For this particular stock, a market order for 3000 shares (not even $4000, this is a reasonably small figure) will move the stock past $1.34, more than a 3% move.  Say, on the Ask side there are 100,000 shares, all with $10 ask. It would take a lot of orders to purchase all these shares, so for a while, the price may stay right at $10, or a bit lower if there are those willing to sell lower.  But, say that side showed $10 1000, $10.25 500, $10.50 1000. Now, the volume is so low that if I decided I wanted shares at any price, my order, a market order will actually drive the market price right up to $10.50 if I buy 2500 shares \"market\".  You see, however, even though I'm a small trader, I drove the price up. But now that the price is $10.50 when I go to sell all 2500 at $10.50, there are no bids to pay that much, so the price the next trade will occur at isn't known yet. There may be bids at $10, with asking (me) at $10.50. No trades will happen until a seller takes the $10 bid or other buyers and sellers come in."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a few reasons why low volume can move a stock price drastically.First, low volume means there are fewer buyers and sellers in the market, so a small number of trades can have a disproportionate impact on the price. For example, if there are only a few buyers and one of them decides to place a large buy order, that could push the price up significantly. Similarly, if there are only a few sellers and one of them decides to place a large sell order, that could push the price down significantly.Second, low volume can make a stock more vulnerable to manipulation. If a small group of traders or investors are able to control a significant portion of the trading volume, they may be able to manipulate the price by placing large orders in one direction or the other.Finally, low volume can also be a sign of a lack of interest in a particular stock, which can make it more volatile.

{"question":"How does compounding of annual interest work?","human_answers":["Here's how I have worked it out.  Different answer to the one expected.  Pretty sure it's right though."],"chatgpt_answers":["Compound interest is the interest that is calculated on the initial principal, which includes all of the accumulated interest of previous periods. This means that the longer the money is invested, the more compound interest it will accrue, leading to exponential growth over time.Here is an example of how compound interest works:Let's say you have $1000 invested in an account that earns a 5% annual compound interest rate. After the first year, you would earn $50 in interest (5% of $1000 is $50). If the interest is compounded annually, the balance in your account at the end of the first year would be $1050 ($1000 principal + $50 interest).Now let's say you leave the money in the account for another year. In the second year, you would earn interest not only on the initial $1000 principal, but also on the $50 in interest that was accumulated in the first year. This means that in the second year, you would earn 5% of $1050, or $52.50 in interest. The balance in your account at the end of the second year would be $1102.50 ($1050 principal + $52.50 interest).As you can see, the amount of interest earned increases each year due to the compound interest effect.

{"question":"Can you explain this options calls & puts quote table to me?","human_answers":["(Note: I am omitting the currency units.  While I strongly suspect it's US$ I don't know from the chart.  The system works the same no matter what the currency.) A call or a put is the right to sell (put) or buy (call) shares at a certain price on a certain day. This is why you see a whole range of prices.  Not all possible stock values are represented, the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable.  In this case the choices are even units, for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this. The top of the chart says it's for June.  It's actually the third Friday in the month, June 15th in this case.  Thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days. While the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100. The left side of the chart shows calls.  Suppose you sell a call at 19 (the top of the chart)  The last such trade would have gotten you a premium of 9.70 per share (the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26.)  Note the volume, bid and ask columns though--you're not going to get 9.70 for such a call as there is no buyer.  The most anybody is offering at present is 7.80 a share. Now, lets look farther down in the chart--say, a strike price of 30.  The last trade was only .10--people think it's very unlikely that FB will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price.  If FB stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away.  If it's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they'll exercise the option, take your shares and pay you 30 for them.  Note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call, you can't back out later if it becomes a bad deal. Going over to the other side of the chart with the puts: Here the transaction goes the other way, come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price.  Lets look at the same values we did before.  19?  There's no trading, you can't do it. 30?  Here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put.  Come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share.  If it's still 26 they're certainly going to do so, but if it's up to 31 it's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 Note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you don't own the shares in question.  This is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite.  If the stock somehow zoomed up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market--you would have to come up with a million dollars.

{"question":"How do I evaluate a health insurance policy that covers a specific disease?","human_answers":["These policies are usually called dread disease policies or critical illness insurance, and they normally aren't a good deal. Furthermore, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, such policies may become less common or disappear entirely. These policies aren't a great deal because of the effects of adverse selection and asymmetric information, two closely related concepts in the economics of insurance. When you purchase an insurance policy, the insurance company charges you a premium based on your average risk level or the average risk level of your risk pool, e.g. you and your fellow employees, if you get insurance through your employer. For health insurance, this average risk level is the average probability that you'll incur healthcare costs. The insurer's actuaries calculate this probability from numerous factors, like your age, sex, current health, socioeconomic status, etc. Asymmetric information exists when you know more about this probability than the insurance company does. For example, you may look like a relatively low-risk individual on paper, but little does the insurance company know, BASE jumping is one of your hobbies. Because you know about your hobby and the insurance company doesn't, you secretly know that your risk of incurring healthcare expenses is much higher than the insurance company expects. If the insurance company knew this, they would like to charge you a much higher premium, if they could. However, they can't, because a) they don't know about your hobby, and b) the premium may be decided for the entire group\/risk pool, so they can't increase it simply because a few individuals in the group have higher risk levels. Adverse selection occurs when individuals with higher risk levels are more likely to buy insurance. You may decide that because of your dangerous hobby, you do want to take advantage of your employer's healthcare plan. Unfortunately for the insurance company, they can't adjust their price accordingly. Adverse selection is a major factor in insurance markets, so I didn't go into much detail here (too much detail is probably off-topic anyway). I can point you towards more resources on the topic if you're interested.  However, the situation is different when you purchase a dread disease policy.  By expressing interest in such a specific policy, e.g. a cancer insurance policy, you signal to the insurance company that you feel you have a higher risk of facing that disease. In your case, you're signaling to the insurance company that your family probably has a history of cancer or that you have habits that make you more susceptible to it, and your premiums will be higher to compensate the insurance company for bearing this additional risk. Since the insurance company already has a rough estimate of your chances of developing that illness, they may already know that you have a higher chance of facing it. However, when you express interest in a disease-specific policy, this signals the existence of asymmetric information (your family history or other habits), and the insurer assumes you know something they don't that elevates your risk level of that specific disease. Since these policies are optional policies often sold as riders to existing policies, the insurance company has more flexibility in pricing them. They can charge you a higher premium because you've signaled to the insurer that you have a significantly above-average risk of contracting a specific disease*. Also, the insurer can do a much better job of estimating the expected costs of insuring you since they need only focus on data surrounding one disease. The policy will be priced accordingly, i.e. in such a way that isn't necessarily beneficial to you. Furthermore, most dread disease policies aren't guaranteed renewable, which means that even if you are willing to keep paying the premiums, the insurance company doesn't have to keep insuring you. As your risk of developing the specific disease grows, e.g. with age, it may pass the point where insuring you is no longer an acceptable risk. The company expects you to develop the illness with the next few renewal cycles, so they decide not to renew your policy. The end result? The insurance company has the premiums you've paid previously, but you no longer have coverage for that illness, and ex post, you've suffered a net loss with no reduction of risk for the foreseeable future.  Dread disease policies are changing under the Affordable Care Act. According to healthcare.gov Starting in 2014, ... all new health insurance plans sold to individuals and small businesses, and plans purchased in the new Affordable Insurance Exchanges, must include a range of essential health benefits. The essential health benefits include quite a few areas of coverage; since this applies to policies offered on the state insurance exchanges and those offered outside of it, dread disease policies wouldn't seem to qualify. For more information, you can read the linked page on healthcare.gov or see Section 1302, subsection b), titled \"Essential Health Benefits Requirements\" in the law itself (p87). I imagine more details will be available on a state-by-state basis through 2014 and into 2015.  One legal source (see the discussion on p24) states that: whatever else the ACA does with excepted benefit policies, including specific disease and fixed dollar indemnity policies, it does explicitly provide that such policies do not count as minimum essential coverage for purposes of the ACA This seems pretty straightforward; a dread disease (or \"specific disease\" policy, as it's referred to in the article), won't count towards the minimum essential requirements. This may not be an issue for you, but for others, it's important to understand that you'll still need to pay the penalty if you only purchase one of these policies. The ACA spells this out in Section 5000(f) (see p316, which states that \"excepted benefit policies\" are excluded and defines them using the definition in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). **The PSHA specifically includes \"Coverage only for a specified disease or illness\" in their definition of \"excepted benefit policies\" (see section 2791(b), paragraph 3A on p82, so it's probably a safe bet that such policies won't count towards the minimum. Also, as Rick pointed out in the comments, the Affordable Care Act also forbids lifetime limits on most insurance plans, so assuming you find an insurance policy with adequate coverage for the specific disease you're worried about, such a plan should cover the related expenses without a lifetime limit. Deductibles, annual limits, and other factors may complicate this somewhat.  In the section about lifetime limits (Sec. 2711, p2), the Affordable Care Act states that: A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish ... lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary.  However, the law states in the next paragraph that the preceding statement should not be construed to prevent a group health plan or health insurance coverage from placing annual or lifetime per beneficiary limits on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits under section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under Federal or State law The section also contains similarly vague caveats about annual limits, so the actual details and limits may vary once individual states finalize their policies. The law is intentionally vague because the vast majority of the law's implementation is left up to individual states. Furthermore, certain parts of the law specify actions involving the Secretary of Health and Human Services, so these may require further codification in the future too. You should still read the fine print of any insurance policy you buy and evaluate it as you would any contract (see the next section).  Since a dread disease policy probably isn't a good idea, you'll probably want to evaluate the healthcare plans offered by your employer or individual plans offered in your area (if your employer doesn't offer coverage). I've tried to include the basic points offered in these articles to give you or future visitors some idea of where to start. These points may change once the Affordable Care Act is implemented, so I'll try to keep them as general as possible.  Services - Above and beyond the minimum essential requirements, what services does the plan offer? Are these services a good match for you and\/or your family, or do they add unnecessary cost to the premium with little or no benefit? For example, my health insurance plan offers basic dental coverage with a small co-pay, so I don't need a separate dental plan, even though my employer offers one.  Choice - What doctors, clinics, hospitals, etc. are preferred providers under your plan? Do you need a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist, or can you find one on your own? Are the preferred providers convenient for you? In my first year of college (about five years ago), my student health insurance only covered a few hospitals that were in the suburbs and somewhat difficult for me to reach. This is something to keep in mind, depending on where you live.  Costs - This is a major one, obviously. Deductibles, copays, maximum cost limits over a year or your lifetime, out-of-network costs, etc. are all variables to consider.  There are other factors, but since I don't have a family, other members of the site can provide more detailed information about what to look for in family policies.  In place of a dread disease policy, you're likely better off purchasing a comprehensive health insurance policy, perhaps a catastrophic coverage policy with a high deductible that will kick in once you've exhausted your standard insurance policy. However, this may be a moot point since the passage of the Affordable Care Act may significantly reduce the availability of such policies anyway."],"chatgpt_answers":["Evaluating a health insurance policy that covers a specific disease can be a complex process, as it involves considering a range of factors including the policy's coverage limits, exclusions, and deductibles. Here are some steps you can take to evaluate a health insurance policy that covers a specific disease:Understand the policy's coverage limits: Make sure you understand the policy's coverage limits for the specific disease you are interested in. This includes any limits on the number of visits or treatments covered, as well as any limits on the amount of money the policy will pay out for the specific disease.Look for exclusions: Check the policy's exclusions to see if there are any conditions or treatments that are not covered. This can be especially important if you have a preexisting condition or are considering a specific treatment that may not be covered.Consider the policy's deductibles: Consider the policy's deductibles, which are the amount of money you have to pay out of pocket before the insurance company starts covering your medical expenses. Make sure you understand the policy's deductibles and whether they are feasible for you to pay.Compare the policy to others: Compare the policy you are considering to other policies available to you. This can help you get a sense of the policy's value and whether it is a good fit for your needs.Consider seeking professional advice: If you are having difficulty understanding the policy or evaluating its coverage, consider seeking the advice of a health insurance broker or agent who can help you understand the policy and its terms."]},

{"question":"Low risk withdrawal from market.

In addition you may be faced with required minimum distributions from these accounts.  But even before you get to those points you will generally shift the focus of new funds into the retirement account to be more conservative. Depending on the balances in the various accounts and the size of the pension and social security accounts you may even move invested funds from aggressive to conservative investments. The proper proportion of the many different types of investments and revenue streams is open to much debate. During retirement you will be pulling money out of retirement accounts either to support your standard of living or to meet the required minimum distributions. What to sell will be based on either the tax implications or the required distributions that will still maintain the asset allocation you desire.   If your distributions are driven by the law you will be selling enough to meet a specific required $ figure. You will either spend that money or move it into a low interest savings account or a non-retirement investment account. If trying to meet your standard of living expectations you will be selling funds that allow you to keep your desired asset allocation but still have enough to live on.

{"question":"Closing a credit card with an annual fee without hurting credit score?","human_answers":["The two factors that will hurt you the most is the age of the credit account, and your available credit to debt ratio.

However, it is important to note that the tax treatment of dividends can vary depending on the type of dividend and the individual's tax situation.If you receive dividends from stocks that you own, you should receive a Form 1099-DIV from the payer detailing the amount of dividends that you received. You will need to report the dividends on your tax return and pay tax on them at your ordinary income tax rate, unless they are qualified dividends, which may be eligible for lower tax rates.It is important to keep in mind that the tax treatment of dividends can be complex and you may want to consult a tax professional for advice on your specific situation.","When you receive dividends from stocks that you own, you may have to pay taxes on those dividends. The tax rate that you pay on your dividends will depend on the type of dividends that you receive and your tax bracket.Qualified dividends are taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains, which are generally lower than the tax rates for ordinary income. To be eligible for the lower tax rates on qualified dividends, you must meet certain holding period requirements. Generally, you must hold the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date.Nonqualified dividends are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, which is the rate that you pay on your other taxable income.It's important to note that you may also have to pay state and local taxes on your dividends, depending on where you live.I recommend consulting with a tax professional or referring to the IRS guidelines for more information on the tax implications of dividends."]},
{"question":"Why are interbank payment (settlement) systems closed for weekends and holidays?","human_answers":["TARGET2 is a high value realtime settlement system across Europe and for this to be open on weekends would mean all the Banks including Central Banks in the Euro Zone work. Quite a few times to manage intra day liquidity, banks borrow from each other, hence there is an active monitering of the liquidity by Banks. The borrowing happens over phone and fax and the lending bank sending a high value transaction that credits the borrowing banks. These is the day to day job of treasury group [highly paid individuals] to manage liquidity. Now if on weekends the volume is less, it does not make sense to keep these people, the cost of supporting this for very insiginificant business gain is not driving to build such systems.  On the other hand on retail transactions, say Cards [Debit \/ Credit], ATM, the value is not high and hence there is no treasury function involved and there is a huge need, everything is automated. So no issues."],"chatgpt_answers":["Interbank payment systems, such as the Federal Reserve's Fedwire or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication's (SWIFT) system, are typically closed on weekends and holidays because they are operated by financial institutions, which are typically closed on those days. In addition, these systems are used to facilitate the transfer of large sums of money between banks, and it may not be necessary for these transfers to take place on a 24\/7 basis.One of the main functions of interbank payment systems is to allow banks to settle their financial transactions with each other. These transactions can include things like the transfer of funds between banks, the exchange of securities, and the settlement of derivatives contracts. Because these transactions are usually not time-sensitive, it is not necessary for the systems to be open at all times.There are also operational and logistical reasons for why interbank payment systems may be closed on weekends and holidays. For example, the staff and resources needed to operate and maintain the systems may not be available on those days. Additionally, the systems may require regular maintenance or updates, which can be more easily scheduled when the systems are not in use.Overall, the closure of interbank payment systems on weekends and holidays is a reflection of the overall operation of the financial industry, which tends to follow a standard schedule. It is not intended to cause inconvenience to users, but rather is a practical consideration based on the needs and operations of the financial sector."]},

{"question":"Next option(s) after house is not selling on market?","human_answers":["EDIT: new ideas based on the full story. I wouldn't worry about the price history.  While it is certainly true that some buyers might try to leverage that information against you, the bottom line is the price is the price.  Both the buyer and the seller have to agree.   If the initial listing was too high, then lower the price.  If that isn't low enough, then readjust down.  I see no harm in moving the price down over time repeatedly.  In fact, I thin that is a good tactic to getting the most for the house.  If you happen to have the luxury of time, then keep lowering that price until it sells.  Don't fret how that behavior appears. You can lower the price as often as you like until it sells.  I am not a real estate agent, and I am a terrible negotiator, but I would lower the price every quarter until it sells.  You can't go down to fast (a buyer might wait you out) and you can't wait to long as you stated.  Also, if you house is priced inline with the neighborhood, you can at least get offers and negotiate. Buy asking for such a premium (25%) folks might not even make an offer. You simply need to decide what is more important, the selling price or the time frame in getting it sold. If you house doesn't sell because the market doesn't support your price, then consider keeping it as a rental.  You can do it yourself, or if you are not interested in that (large) amount of work, then hire a rental management company to do it for a fee. Renting a home is hard work and requires attention to detail, a good amount of your time and much labor.  If you just need to wait a couple of years before selling, renting it can be a good option to cover your costs while you wait for the market to reach you. You should get advice on how to handle the money, how to rent it, how to deal with renters, and the the laws are in your jurisdiction. Rent it out to a trusted friend or family member for a steal of a deal.  They save money, and you get the luxury of time waiting for the sale. With a real estate lawyer you hire, get a contract for a lease option or owner finance deal on the house.  Sometimes you can expand the market of people looking to buy your house.  If you have a willing purchaser will bad credit, you can be doing them a favor and solving your own issue.  It costs money and you will make less on the sale, but it could be better than nothing. Take heed, there is a reason some people cannot get a traditional loan on their own.  Before you extend your good name or credit think about it.  It is another hassle for sure. This won't help if you have to pay off a mortgage, but you could donate it.  This is another tricky deal that you really need to speak with a lawyer who specialize in charitable giving.  There are tax benefits, but I would make any kind of a deal where tax deductions are the only benefit. This is common enough these days.  If you are unable to pay for the mortgage, it benefits you and the bank to get into a short sale arrangement.  They bank gets probably more money than if they have to foreclose (and they save money on legal fees) and you can get rid of the obligation. You will do a deed in lieu or the short sale depending on how the market it and what the house can be sold for.  You and the bank will have to work it out. This will ruin for a credit for a while, and you will not likely qualify to get a new mortgage for at least a few years. You can stop paying your mortgage, tell the bank and they will foreclose.  This is going to ruin your credit for a long time as well as disqualify you from mortgages in the near future.  Don't do this.  If you are planning a foreclosure, take the time to contact your bank and arrange a short sale or a deed in lieu.  There isn't really any excuse to go into foreclosure if you are having problems.

{"question":"What is a subsidy?","human_answers":["A subsidy is a payment made by a group (usually the state) to individuals or corporations in order to shift the balance if the rational economic decision for the individual would be detrimental to the group as a whole otherwise. For example, if there are different quality kinds of crops that can be planted, for example a GM maize that brings in high yields but can only be processed to High Fructose Corn Syrup or a naturally bred corn that brings lower yields but tastes well enough for direct consumption, then if demand for both exceeds supply, the economic choice for the individual farmer is to plant the former. If the claims that HFCS contribute to obesity are founded, then it is in the public interest to produce less of it, and more alternative foods. Given that a market rather than a planned economy is desired, this cannot be achieved by decree, but rather money is used as an incentive. In the long term, this investment may very well pay off through reduced health care costs, so it is a rational economic decision from the state's point of view.

{"question":"Definition of \u201cU.S. source\u201d for US non-resident alien capital gains tax","human_answers":["The examples you provide in the question are completely irrelevant. It doesn't matter where the brokerage is or where is the company you own stocks in. For a fairly standard case of an non-resident alien international student living full time in the US - your capital gains are US sourced. Let me quote the following text a couple of paragraphs down the line you quoted on the same page: Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of personal property generally   has its source in the United States if the alien has a tax home in the   United States. The key factor in determining if an individual is a   U.S. resident for purposes of the sourcing of capital gains is whether   the alien's \"tax home\" has shifted to the United States. If an alien   does not have a tax home in the United States, then the alien\u2019s U.S.   source capital gains would be treated as foreign-source and thus   nontaxable. In general, under the \"tax home\" rules, a person who is away (or who   intends to be away) from his tax home for longer than 1 year has   shifted tax homes to his new location upon his arrival in that new   location. See Chapter 1 of Publication 463, Travel, Entertainment,   Gift, and Car Expenses I'll assume you've read this and just want an explanation on what it means. What it means is that if you move to the US for a significant period of time (expected length of 1 year or more), your tax home is assumed to have shifted to the US and the capital gains are sourced to the US from the start of your move. For example: you are a foreign diplomat, and your 4-year assignment started in May. Year-end - you're not US tax resident (diplomats exempt), but you've stayed in the US for more than 183 days, and since your assignment is longer than 1 year - your tax home is now in the US. You'll pay the 30% flat tax. Another example: You're a foreign airline pilot, coming to the US every other day flying the airline aircraft. You end up staying in the US 184 days, but your tax home hasn't shifted, nor you're a US tax resident - you don't pay the flat tax. Keep in mind, that tax treaties may alter the situation since in many cases they also cover the capital gains situation for non-residents."],"chatgpt_answers":["For tax purposes, the term \"U.S. source\" refers to the origin of a particular type of income.

{"question":"What can my relatives do to minimize their out of pocket expenses on their fathers estate","human_answers":["Sure, it's irresponsible for an executor to take actions which endanger the estate.  But what about passivity or inaction?  Put it another way.  Is it the obligation of the executor to avoid making revenue for the estate?  Think about it - what a silly idea!   Consider a 12-unit apartment building full of rent paying tenants.  A tenant gives notice and leaves.  So do 4 more.  With only 7\/12 tenants, the building stops being a revenue center and becomes a massive money pit.  Is that acceptable?  Heck no!  Realistically this will be managed by a property management company, and of course they'll seek new tenants, not stopping merely because the owner died.  This situation is not different; the same fiscal logic applies.  The counter-argument is usually along the lines of \"stuff might happen if you rent it out\"... true. But the stuff that happens to abandoned houses is much worse, and much more likely: squatters, teen \"urban explorers\", pot growers, copper thieves, winter pipe freeze flooding and wrecking interiors, etc.  Don't take my word on it -- ask your insurer for the cost of insuring an abandoned house vs. a rented one.  Renting brings a chunk of cash that comes in from tenants - $12,000\/year on a $1000\/mo. rental. And that will barely pay the bills if you have a young mortgage on a freshly purchased house at recent market rates.  But on an old mortgage, renting is like printing money.  That money propagates first to the estate (presumably it is holding back a \"fix the roof\" emergency fund), and then to the beneficiaries.  It means getting annual checks from the estate, instead of constantly being dunned for another repair.  But I don't care about making revenue (outside of putting back a kitty to replace the roof).  Even if it was net zero, it means the maintenance is being done.  This being the point.  It is keeping the house in good repair, occupied, insured, and professionally managed -- fit and ready for the bequest's purpose: occupancy of an aunt.  What's the alternative?  Move an aunt into a house that's been 10 years abandoned?  Realistically the heirs are going to get tired\/bored of maintaining the place at a total cash loss, maintenance will slip, and you'll be moving them into a neglected house with some serious issues.  That betrays the bequest, and it's not fair to the aunts. Rental is a very responsible thing to do.  The executor shouldn't fail to do it merely out of passivity.  If you decide not to do it, there needs to be a viable alternative to funding the home's decent upkeep.  (I don't think there is one).  Excluding a revenue-producing asset from the economy is an expensive thing to do."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several steps that your relatives can take to minimize their out-of-pocket expenses on your father's estate:Gather all necessary documents: This includes the will, any trust documents, deeds to property, and financial statements.

{"question":"How will Brexit affect house mortgages?","human_answers":["Nobody can predict the affects of Brexit but it is wise to consider them. We saw the pound weaken after the vote to leave and it is possible the pound will weaken further after Brexit and this devaluation could be quite dramatic. If that happens it is likely to increase inflation, UK inflation has gone from under 1% around the time of the referendum to 3% today and it could well go higher. https:\/\/www.rateinflation.com\/inflation-rate\/uk-historical-inflation-rate If inflation continues to increase, the Bank of England is likely to put up interest rates, as it has historically done this to hedge against inflation.  We have been living in a world of artificially low interest rates since the global crash of 2008 as the BoE has tried to stimulate recovery with lower rates.  The rates cannot continue at this level if inflation starts to rise. http:\/\/www.thisismoney.co.uk\/money\/news\/article-2387744\/Base-rate-vs-inflation-chart-How-tell-things-really-got-better.html That in turn will put up mortgage rates.  So for example if you have a \u00a3100k mortgage at 3.92% (currently this is a reasonable rate to have) your repayments will be \u00a3523 a month.  If your mortgage rate goes up to say 7% then your repayments are \u00a3707 a month, if it goes up to 10% then it's \u00a3909 a month and so on. There is a mortgage calculator you can use to try playing with different amounts here: https:\/\/www.moneysavingexpert.com\/mortgages\/mortgage-rate-calculator My advice would therefore be try to get as small a mortgage as you can and make sure you can afford it quite comfortably, in case rates go up and you need to find a few hundred pounds a month extra. There are other risks from Brexit as well, house prices could fall as people decide not to buy properties due to excessive interest rates!

{"question":"Why are bank transactions not instant?","human_answers":["It is a rather complex system, but here is a rough summary. Interbank tranfers ultimately require a transfer of reserves at the central bank. As a concrete example, the bank of england system is the rtgs. Only the clearing banks and similar (e.g. bacs) have access to rtgs. You can send a chaps payment fairly quickly, but that costs. Chaps immediately triggers an rtgs transfer once the sending bank agrees and so you can be certain that the money is being paid.  Hence its use for large amounts. Bacs also sits on the rtgs but to keep costs down it batches tranfers up. Because we are talking about bank reserve movements, checks have to be in place and that can take time. Furthermore the potential for fraud is higher than chaps since these are aggregrated transactions a layer removed, so a delay reduces the chance of payment failing after apparently being sent. Faster payments is a new product by bacs that speeds up the bacs process by doing a number of transfers per day. Hence the two hour clearing. For safety it can only be used for up to 10k. Second tier banks will hold accounts with clearing banks so they are another step down. Foreign currency transfers require the foreign Central Bank reserve somewhere, and so must be mediated by at least one clearing bank in that country. Different countries are at different stages in their technology.  Uk clearing is 2h standard now but US is a little behind I believe.  Much of Europe is speeding up. Rather like bitcoin clearing, you have a choice between speed and safety.

Your credit rating, also known as your credit score, is a measure of your creditworthiness based on your credit history. It is used by lenders, landlords, and others to assess the risk of extending credit or renting to you.There are a few ways that your cell phone contract could potentially affect your credit rating indirectly:Payment history: If you consistently pay your cell phone bill on time, this can demonstrate to lenders that you are responsible and reliable with your payments, which could improve your credit rating. Conversely, if you consistently miss payments or pay late, this could negatively affect your credit rating.Credit utilization: Your credit utilization is the percentage of your available credit that you are using. If you have a large balance on your cell phone contract, this could increase your credit utilization and potentially lower your credit rating.Credit inquiries: When you apply for a new cell phone contract, the provider may perform a credit check, which could result in a \"hard\" inquiry on your credit report. Having too many hard inquiries in a short period of time can lower your credit rating.In general, it's important to manage your credit responsibly by paying your bills on time, keeping your balances low, and limiting the number of credit inquiries you have.

{"question":"Take car loan out of mortgage to improve equity","human_answers":["I guess I don't understand how you figure that taking out a car loan for $20k will result in adding $20k in equity.  A car loan is a liability, not an asset like your $100k in cash.  Besides, you don't get a dollar-for-dollar consideration when figuring a car's value against the loan it is encumbered by.  In other words, the car is only worth what someone's willing to pay for it, not what your loan amount on it is. Remember that taking on a loan will increase your debt-to-income ratio, which is always a factor when trying to obtain a mortgage.  At the same time, taking on new debt just prior to shopping for a mortgage could make it more difficult to find a lender.  Every time a credit report (hard inquiry) is run on you, it temporarily impacts your credit score.  The only exception to this rule is when it comes to mortgages.  In the U.S., the way it works is that once you start shopping for a mortgage with lenders, for the next 30 days, additional inquiries into your credit report for purposes of mortgage funding do not count against your credit score, so it's a \"freebie\" in a way.  You can't use this to shop for any other kind of credit, but the purpose is to allow you a chance to shop for the best mortgage rate you can get without adversely impacting your credit. In the end, my advice is to stop looking at how much house you can buy, and instead focus on a house with payments you can live with and afford.  Trying to buy the most house based on what someone's willing to lend you leaves no room in the near-term for being able to borrow if the property has some repair needs, you want to furnish\/upgrade it, or for any other unanticipated need which may arise that requires credit.

When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power of money.One way that investing in housing can provide a hedge against inflation is by increasing in value along with the general price level. If the value of a house increases at a rate that is equal to or greater than the rate of inflation, the owner of the house may be able to sell the house for a higher price in the future and effectively preserve their purchasing power.However, there are several factors that can affect the relationship between the value of a house and the rate of inflation. For example, the value of a house may not increase at the same rate as the general price level if there are changes in the demand for housing or if the house is in a location that becomes less desirable. Additionally, the value of a house may be affected by factors such as the condition of the house, the quality of the neighborhood, and the availability of financing.It is important to keep in mind that investing in housing carries its own set of risks, including the possibility of a decline in the value of the property.

If you already have a large-cap ETF, you may consider adding a small-cap ETF to your portfolio to further diversify your holdings.Small-cap stocks, which are typically defined as companies with a market capitalization of $2 billion or less, tend to be riskier than large-cap stocks but may also offer the potential for higher returns. By including both large-cap and small-cap stocks in your portfolio, you can potentially benefit from the potential upside of small-cap stocks while also limiting your overall risk through the more stable returns of large-cap stocks.It's important to keep in mind that investing in any individual security or ETF carries some level of risk, and you should carefully consider your investment objectives and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. It's also a good idea to consult with a financial professional to determine the appropriate mix of investments for your specific situation."]},

{"question":"Should I invest in my house, when it's in my wife's name?","human_answers":["It is my opinion that part of having a successful long-term relationship is being committed to the other person's success and well-being. This commitment is a form of investment in and of itself. The returns are typically non-monetary, so it's important to understand what money actually is. Money is a token people exchange for favors. If I go to a deli and ask for a sandwich. I give them tokens for the favor of having received a sandwich. The people at the deli then exchange those tokens for other favors, and that's the entire economy: people doing favors for other people in exchange for tokens that represent more favors.

It sounds like what you are describing is rapidly trading the option in order to obtain returns similar to those of the stock.  The equality goes both ways.   If the option is appropriately priced, then a strategy that replicates stock returns using the option will cost the same as buying the stock. Because you can't trade continuously, you won't actually be able to replicate the stock return, and it may seem like you are making arbitrage profit (puts may seem abnormally expensive), but you do so by bearing tail risk (i.e., selling puts loses more money than owning the associated stock if an unusually bad event occurs)."],"chatgpt_answers":["Buying a stock means purchasing ownership in a company with the expectation that the stock will increase in value over time.

A put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a stock at a certain price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiration date). When you sell a naked put, you are agreeing to buy the stock at the strike price if the holder of the put option chooses to exercise their right to sell the stock to you.There are some key differences between buying a stock and selling a naked put:Risk: When you buy a stock, you are taking on the risk that the stock will decrease in value, which could result in a loss. When you sell a naked put, you are taking on the risk that the stock will increase in value, which could also result in a loss if you are required to buy the stock at a higher price than the current market price.Potential return: When you buy a stock, your potential return is the difference between the purchase price and the sale price of the stock. When you sell a naked put, your potential return is the premium that you receive for selling the put option, minus the cost of buying the stock if the option is exercised.Requirements: Buying a stock requires you to have the cash to pay for the stock upfront. Selling a naked put requires you to have margin available in your account, as you may be required to buy the stock at any time before the expiration date of the option.Both buying a stock and selling a naked put can be risky and are not suitable for all investors.

{"question":"What are the usual terms of a \u201crent with an option to buy\u201d situation?","human_answers":["While the other people have tried to answer your question as thoroughly as possible, I fear they are entirely incorrect in answering your question itself as it stands. The answer is that there are no usual terms. There are a handful of different options coming out now for this exact scheme. Examples include the UK Governments \"Help To Buy\" scheme. Accomodation is offered at a normal rate, and a small portion of the rent is set aside each month. At the end of a fixed period, that money becomes a deposit which the letter hands over to a mortgage provider who accepts it as a deposit. This might well be a terminology thing, since the other scenario which people described falls into the same name you've used. That scenario is where the investor who owns the property is considering sale of the property, and is happy to negotiate a price up front for the next year. Usually the rent and price is higher than the market rate because if the market goes well over the next year they could end up out of pocket. Putting that into perspective, over that year they are gaining their $1,000 a month or so, but having $100,000 invested means a return of 12%. If the property value is over $250,000 which I believe to be more likely, they are achieving a return of (I think) 4.8%. That's not a bad rate, by any means, but realistically they are losing a bit more for maintenance, and they could be making more from their money. If the market were to go up in that time by more than 4.8% (my house, for instance, increased in value by over 15% in the last 12 months), they are making a substantial loss since you are getting a house at 15% below the market rate. The total works out to a 10.2% loss for them. Note that I don't know the US housing market at all, I'm speaking mostly from my experience of the market here in the UK. This is what I hear, what I see, and what I've played.

This can be particularly appealing if the company's shares are undervalued, as it allows the company to buy back shares at a lower price and potentially improve its earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE).Share buybacks: A company might use the proceeds from debt issuance to buy back its own shares. This can help reduce the number of outstanding shares and increase the value of the remaining shares. Share buybacks can also signal to the market that the company believes its shares are undervalued.Dividends: A company might also use the proceeds from debt issuance to pay dividends to its shareholders. This can be a way to distribute profits to shareholders and return value to them.It's worth noting that selling debt to finance share buybacks and dividends can be risky, as it can increase the company's financial leverage and leave it vulnerable to changes in interest rates or a downturn in its business. Companies should carefully consider their financial position and the risks associated with taking on additional debt before making this decision."]},
{"question":"Evaluating worth of ESPP (Startup)","human_answers":["You have a lot of different questions in your post - I am only responding to the request for how to value the ESPP. When valuing an ESPP, don't think about what you might sell the shares for in the future, think about what the market would charge you for that option today. In general, an option is worth much less than the underlying share itself. For the simplest example, assume you work at a public company, and your exercise price for your options is $.30, and you can only exercise those options until the end of today, and the cost of the shares on the public stock exchange is also $.30. You have the same 'strike price' as everyone else in the market, making your option worth nothing. In truth, holding that right to a specific strike price into the future does give you value, because it means you can realize the upside in share price gains, without risking any money on share losses. So, how do you value the options? If it's a public company with an active options market, you can easily compare your $.30 strike price with the value of call options in the market that have a $.30 strike price. That becomes the value to you of the option (caveat: it is unlikely you can find an exact match for the terms of your vesting period, but you should be able to find a good starting point). If it's a public company without an active options market, you will have to do a bit of estimation. If a current share is worth $.25 (so, close to your strike price), then your option is worth a little bit, but not much. Compare other shares in your industry \/ company size to get examples of the relative value between an option and a share. If the current share price is worth $.35, then your option is worth about $.05 [the $.05 profit you could get by immediately exercising and selling, plus a bit more for an option on a share that you can't buy in the open market]. If it's a private company, then you need to be very clear on how shares are to be valued, and what methods you have available to sell back to the company \/ other individuals. You can then consider as per above, how to value the option for a share, vs the share itself. Without a clear way to sell your shares of a private company [ideally through a sale directly back to the company that you are able to force them to agree on; ie: the company will buyback shares at 5x Net income for the previous year, or something like that], then the value of a small number of shares is very nebulous. There is an extremely limited market for shares of private companies, if you don't own enough to exert control. In your case, because the valuation appears to be $2\/share [be sure that these are the same share classes you have the option to buy], your option would be worth a little more than $1.70, if you didn't have to wait 4 years to exercise it. This would be total compensation of about $10k, if you were able to exercise today. Many people don't end up working for an early job in their career for 4 years, so you need to consider whether how much that will reduce the value of the ESPP for you personally. Compared with salary of 90k, 10k worth of stock in 4 years may not be a heavy motivating compensation consideration. Note also that because the company is not public, the valuation of $2\/share should be taken with a grain of salt."],"chatgpt_answers":["If you want to evaluate the worth of an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) at a startup, there are a few things you can consider:The discount: Many ESPPs offer a discount on the purchase price of the stock. The larger the discount, the more valuable the ESPP is likely to be.The company's growth potential: If the company is growing rapidly and has a strong market position, the value of its stock is likely to increase over time. This can make the ESPP more valuable.The company's financial health: If the company is financially healthy and has a strong balance sheet, it is more likely to be able to pay dividends in the future and the stock is likely to be more valuable.The vesting period: Some ESPPs have a vesting period, which means that you must remain employed with the company for a certain amount of time before you can sell the stock. The longer the vesting period, the less valuable the ESPP may be.The risk of dilution: If the company is planning to issue a lot of new stock in the future, the value of your stock could be diluted. This is something to consider when evaluating the worth of an ESPP.It's also a good idea to speak with a financial advisor or tax professional to get more specific advice on evaluating the worth of an ESPP.","To evaluate the worth of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) at a startup, you will need to consider a few different factors.First, you should consider the terms of the plan, including the purchase price, the length of the offering period, and any discounts or incentives that are offered.Next, you should consider the financial health of the company and its growth prospects. If the company is performing well and is expected to continue growing, this could make the ESPP a more attractive investment. On the other hand, if the company is struggling or facing uncertain prospects, this could make the ESPP less appealing.It can also be helpful to consider the experience and track record of the company's management team, as well as the company's industry and competitive landscape.Finally, you should also consider your own financial situation and investment goals. This will help you determine whether participating in the ESPP is a good fit for you and whether it aligns with your overall investment strategy."]},

However, the \"emergencies\" usually cited are things like home repair, car repair, needing to replace your car, and so on.

I would be tempted to tell you to get a credit card with a $2000 limit and consider that your emergency fund, just because grad student living is so tight to the bone (been there, and 25 years ago I had $1200 a month, so it must be harder for you now.) If you do manage to save up $1500, and you've really been pinching to do that (walking instead of taking the bus, staying on campus hungry instead of popping out to buy food) let up on yourself when you hit the target. Delaying your graduation by a few months because you're not mentally sharp due to hunger or tiredness will be a far bigger economic hit than not having saved $200 a month for 2 or 3 years. The former is 3-6 months of your new salary, the latter 5-7K.

If investors expect the layoffs to lead to cost savings, they may be more likely to buy the company's stock, which could drive the price up.Improved efficiency: Layoffs can also lead to a more efficient operation, as the company may be able to streamline its processes and become more productive with fewer employees. This can also be seen as a positive by investors and could lead to an increase in the stock price.Market expectations: In some cases, the market may have been expecting the company to announce layoffs, and the stock price may go up as a result of the company meeting these expectations.It's worth noting that stock prices can be influenced by a wide range of factors, and the impact of layoffs on a company's stock price will depend on the specific circumstances of the company and the market.","There are a few reasons why a company's stock price may go up after a layoff.Cost cutting: Layoffs can be a way for a company to reduce its expenses and increase profits.

{"question":"If I use stock as collateral for a loan and I default, does the bank pay taxes when they sell my stock?","human_answers":["The short answer is that the exchange of the stock in exchange for the elimination of a debt is a taxable exchange, and gains or losses are possible for the stock investor as well as the bank.   The somewhat longer answer is best summarized as noting that banks don't usually accept stocks as collateral, mostly because stock values are volatile and most banks are not equipped to monitor the risk involved but it is very much part of the business of stock brokers.   In the USA, as a practical matter I only know of stock brokerages offering loans against stock as part of the standard services of a \"margin account\". You can get a margin account at any US stock broker. The stockholder can deposit their shares in the margin account and then borrow around 50% of the value, though that is a bit much to borrow and a lower amount would be safer from sudden demands for repayment in the form of margin calls. In a brokerage account I can not imagine a need to repay a margin loan if the stocks dividends plus capital appreciation rises in value faster than the margin loan rate creates interest charges...  Trouble begins as the stock value goes down.  When the value of the loan exceeds a certain percentage of the stock value, which can depend on the stock and the broker's policy but is also subject to federal rules like Regulation T, the broker can call in the loan and\/or take initiative to sell the stock to repay the loan.   Notice that this may result in a capital gain or loss, depending on the investor's tax basis which is usually the original cost of the stock.  Of course, this sale affects the taxes of the investor irregardless of who gets the money."],"chatgpt_answers":["If you use stock as collateral for a loan and you default on the loan, the lender may sell the collateral, which in this case would be the stock.

For instance, if stock XYZ trades today at $11 and the available January 2015 XYZ calls have strike prices of $6, $8, $10, $12, $14, and $16, then I would expect the $10 call could be called one strike in the money, the $8 two strikes in the money, etc. Similarly, the $12 and $14 calls would be one and two strikes out of the money, respectively. However, if tomorrow XYZ moves to $13, then the $10 previously known as one strike in the money would now be two strikes in the money, and the $12 would be the new one strike in the money. Perhaps this terminology arose because many option strategies frequently involve using options that are at- or near-the-money, so the \"one strike in\" (or out) of the money contracts would tend to be those employed frequently? Perhaps it makes it easier for people to describe strategies in a more general sense, without citing specific examples. However, the software developer in me dislikes it, given that the measurement is relative to both the current underlying price (which changes quickly), and the strike prices available in the given option series. Hence, I wouldn't use this terminology myself and I suggest you eschew it, too, in favor of something concrete; e.g. specify your contract strikes in dollar terms \u2014 especially when it matters."],"chatgpt_answers":["An option is \"in the money\" if it has intrinsic value, which means that the option's strike price is favorable compared to the underlying asset's market price.

If the option is a put option, it is in the money when the underlying asset's market price is lower than the option's strike price.If an option is \"a certain number of strikes in the money,\" it means that the option's strike price is a certain number of dollars away from the current market price of the underlying asset.

{"question":"Why is a home loan (mortgage) cheaper than gold loan?","human_answers":["Why is a home loan (mortgage) cheaper than gold loan? It has to do with risk. Lending money secured by gold is inherently riskier than a loan secure by your home. Increased risk means the lender must charge more. That's why home loans are cheap compared to loans for other purposes. Home loans are secured by the house. Houses are assets that hold and usually retain some value. Houses are easy to track down (they can't be hidden or moved) in the event that you don't repay your loan. Houses are reasonably liquid, they can be resold to pay off a defaulted loan."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a few reasons why a home loan (mortgage) may be cheaper than a gold loan. One reason is that the interest rates on home loans are generally lower than the interest rates on gold loans. This is because home loans are secured loans, meaning that the lender can seize the borrower's home if they default on the loan. The lender has a greater level of protection with a secured loan, so they are able to offer a lower interest rate.Another reason why a home loan may be cheaper than a gold loan is that the repayment period for a home loan is typically longer than the repayment period for a gold loan. This means that the borrower has more time to pay back the loan, which can make it easier to manage the monthly payments.Finally, the amount of the loan may be a factor in the difference in cost between a home loan and a gold loan. Home loans can be for much larger amounts than gold loans, and the interest rates on large loans tend to be lower than the interest rates on small loans.It's important to note that these are general trends and the specific terms and conditions of a home loan or gold loan will depend on the lender and the borrower's creditworthiness.

Paying off student loans may help reduce your monthly expenses and the overall cost of your debt, while investing in an index fund can potentially provide a long-term return on your investment.One approach could be to use some of the extra money to make additional payments on your student loans to reduce the balance faster and save on interest costs. You could also consider investing a portion of the extra money in an index fund, as long as you have a solid emergency fund in place to cover unexpected expenses.Ultimately, the decision will depend on your personal financial situation and goals. Some factors to consider may include:Your current financial priorities: Are you looking to reduce your debt burden as quickly as possible, or are you more focused on building wealth for the long term?Your risk tolerance: Investing in an index fund carries some level of risk, as the value of your investment may fluctuate.

On the other hand, if you are just looking to pay off your student loans and be debt-free as soon as possible, focusing on paying off your debt may be a better choice.Ultimately, the decision of whether to pay off your student loans or invest in an index fund will depend on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

{"question":"Why would a tender offer be less than the market price?","human_answers":["As an addition to Chris Rea's excellent answer, these tender offers are sometimes made specifically to cast doubt on the current market price. For instance, a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company, also public, might make a tender offer below market price. The market will look at this price and the business relationship, and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they don't. Now, what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock? They sell it, supply goes up, demand goes down, and the price drops. The company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way; directly via the offer, or on the open market. This is, however, usually not successful beyond the very short term, and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the 800-pound gorilla, which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets. Such offers are also very closely watched by the SEC; if there's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner, or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves, the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of SEC and DoJ legal proceedings."],"chatgpt_answers":["A tender offer is a proposal made by a company or individual to purchase a certain number of shares of a publicly traded company at a specific price.

One reason could be that the company is attempting to acquire a large number of shares at a lower cost, which could be beneficial for the company's financial performance.

Unless you're extremely tight and you're trying to squeeze by day by day, asking \"do I have enough cash to buy food for today?\" and so on, you're doing too much work. Here's what I do. I make a list of all my bills. Some are a fixed amount every month, like the mortgage and insurance premiums. Others are variable, like electric and heating bills, but still pretty predictable.  Most bills are monthly, but I have a few that come less frequently, like water bills in my area come every 3 months and I have to pay property taxes twice a year. For these you have to calculate how much they cost each month. Like for the water bill, it's once every 3 months so I divide a typical bill by 3. Always round up or estimate a little high to be safe. Groceries are a little tricky because I don't buy groceries on any regular schedule, and sometimes I buy a whole bunch at once and other times just a few things. When groceries were a bigger share of my income, I kept track of what I spent for a couple of months to figure out an average per month. (Today I'm a little richer and I just think of groceries as coming from my spending money.) I allocate a percentage of my income for contributions to church and charities and count this just like bills. It's a good idea to put aside something for savings and\/or paying down any outstanding loans every month. Then I add these up to say okay, here's how much I need each month to pay the bills. Subtract that from my monthly income and that's what I have for spending money. I get paid twice a month so I generally pay bills when I get paid. For most bills the due date is far enough ahead that I can wait the maximum half a month to pay it. (Worst case the bill comes the day after I pay the bills from this paycheck.)  Then I keep enough money in my checking account to, (a) Cover any bills until the next paycheck and allow for the particularly large bills; and (b) provide some cushion in case I make a mistake -- forget to record a check or make an arithmetic error or whatever; and (c) provide some cushion for short-term unexpected expenses. To be safe, (a) should be the total of your bills for a month, or as close to that as you can manage. (b) should be a couple of hundred dollars if you can manage it, more if you make a lot of mistakes. If you've calculated your expenses properly and only spend the difference, keeping enough money in the bank should fall out naturally. I think it's a lot easier to try to manage your money on a monthly basis than on a daily basis. Most of us don't spend money every day, and we spend wildly different amounts from day to day. Most days I probably spend zero, but then one day I'll buy a new TV or computer and spend hundreds.  Update in response to question What I do in real life is this: To calculate my available cash to spend, I simply take the balance in my checking account -- assuming that all checks and electronic payments have cleared. My mortgage is deducted from my checking every month so I post that to my checking a month in advance. I pay a lot of things with automatic charges to a credit card these days, so my credit card bills are large and can't be ignored. So subtract my credit card balances. Subtract my reserve amount. What's left is how much I can afford to spend. So for example: Say I look at the balance in my checkbook today and it's, say, $3000. That's the balance after any checks and other transactions have cleared, and after subtracting my next mortgage payment. Then I subtract what I owe on credit cards. Let's say that was $1,200. So that leaves $1,800. I try to keep a reserve of $1,500. That's plenty to pay my routine monthly bills and leave a healthy reserve. So subtract another $1,500 leaves $300. That's how much I can spend. I could keep track of this with a spreadsheet or a database but what would that gain? The amount in my checking account is actual money. Any spreadsheet could accumulate errors and get farther and farther from accurate values. I use a spreadsheet to figure out how much spending money I should have each month, but that's just to use as a guideline. If it came to, say, $100, I wouldn't make grandiose plans about buying a new Mercedes. If it came to $5,000 a month than buying a fancy new car might be realistic. It also tells me how much I can spend without having to carefully check balances and add it up. These days I have a fair amount of spending money so when, for example, I recently decided I wanted to buy some software that cost $100 I just bought it with barely a second thought. When my spending money was more like $100 a month, lunch at a fast food place was a big event that I planned weeks in advance. (Obviously, I hope, don't get stupid about \"small amounts\". If you can easily afford $100 for an impulse purchase, that doesn't mean that you can afford $100 five times a day every day.) Two caveats: 1. It helps to have a limited number of credit cards so you can keep the balances under control. I have two credit cards I use for almost everything, so I only have two balances to keep track of. I used to have more and it got confusing, it was easy to lose track of how much I really owed, which is a set up for getting in trouble."],"chatgpt_answers":["To calculate the money needed for bills on a daily basis, you will need to first determine your total monthly expenses for bills. This includes any fixed expenses such as rent or mortgage payments, as well as variable expenses like utilities and groceries.Once you have a list of your monthly expenses, divide that number by the number of days in the month to determine the daily amount you need to set aside for bills. For example, if your total monthly expenses are $2,000 and there are 30 days in the month, you will need to set aside approximately $66.67 per day to cover your bills.It can be helpful to create a budget to track your expenses and ensure that you are setting aside enough money each day to cover your bills. You may also want to consider setting up automatic payments for your bills to ensure that they are paid on time and you do not incur late fees."]},

{"question":"Sell your home and invest in growth stock mutual fund","human_answers":["The 20%+ returns you have observed in the mutual funds are not free money.  They are compensation for the risk associated with owning those funds.  Given the extraordinarily high returns you are seeing I would expect extremely high risk.  This means there is a good possibility of extreme losses at some point.  By putting a lot of money in those mutual funds you are taking a gamble that may or may not pay off. Assuming what your friend is paying you for rent is fair, you are not losing money on your house relative to the market.  You are earning less because you are invested in a less risky asset.  If you want a higher return, you should borrow some money (or sell your house) and invest in the market.  You may make more money that way. But if you do that, you will have a larger chance of losing a lot of money at some point.  That's the way risk works.  No one can promise a 20% return on a risky asset, they can only hint that it may do in the future what it did in the past. A reasonable approach to investment is to get invested in lots of different things: stocks, bonds, real estate.  If you are afraid of risk and willing to earn less, keep more money in safe assets.  If you are willing to take big risks in exchange for the possibility of high returns, move more assets into risky stuff.  If you want extreme returns and are willing to take extreme risk, borrow and use the money to invest in risky assets.

{"question":"How do online referal systems work?","human_answers":["Yeah, I'll take the challenge...:) How trustworthy these are and what are their sources of income? These are in fact two separate questions, but the answers are related. How trustworthy? As trustworthy as they're clear about their own sources of income. If you cannot find any clue as to why, what for and how they're paying you - you probably should walk away. What's too good to be true usually is indeed too good to be true. For those of the sites that I know of their sources of income, it is usually advertisements and surveys. To get paid, you have to watch advertisements and\/or answer surveys. I know of some sites who are legit, and pay people (not money, but gift cards, airline miles, etc) for participating in surveys. My own HMO (Kaiser in California) in fact pays (small amounts) to members who participate in enough surveys, so its legit. Are these sites worthwhile to consider for extra income? Not something you could live off, but definitely can get you enough gift cards for your weekly trip to Starbucks. What do I need to consider tax wise? Usually the amounts are very low, and are not paid in cash. While it is income, I doubt the IRS will chase you if you don't report the $20 Amazon gift card you got from there. It should, strictly speaking, be reported (probably as hobby income) on your tax return. Most people don't bother dealing with such small amounts though. In some cases (like the HMO I mentioned), its basically a rebate of the money paid (you pay your copays, deductibles etc. Since the surveys are only for members, you basically get your money back, not additional income). This is in fact similar to credit card rebates. Is there a best practice for handling the income? If we're talking about significant amounts (more than $20-30 a year), then you need to keep track of the income and related expenses, and report it as any other business income on your taxes, Schedule C. Is there a good test to determine what is and isn't a scam? As I said - if it looks too good to be true - it most likely is. If you're required to provide your personal\/financial information without any explanation as to why, what it will be used for, and why and what for you're going to be paid - I'd walk away. Otherwise, you can also check Internet reviews, BBB ratings, FTC information and the relevant state agencies and consumer watchdogs (for example: http:\/\/www.scamadviser.com) whether they've heard of that particular site, and what is the information they have on it. A very good sign for a scam is contact information. Do they have a phone number to call to? Is it in your own country? If its not in your own country - definitely go away (for example the original link that was in the question pointed to a service whose phone number is in the UK, but listed address is in Los Angeles, CA. A clear sign of a scam). If they do have a phone number - try it, talk to them, call several times and see how many different people you're going to talk to. If its always the same person - run and hide. Do they have an address? If not - walk away. If they do - look it up. Is it a PMB\/POB? A \"virtual\" office?

This buy-and-hold approach can minimize the realization of capital gains, which are taxable events. In contrast, actively trading stocks can result in more frequent realization of capital gains, which can increase your tax liability. Additionally, index funds may have lower turnover than actively managed funds, which can also reduce the potential for realizing capital gains.It is worth noting that index funds can still generate capital gains, as they may need to sell securities to rebalance their portfolio or to meet redemptions by investors. However, these capital gains are typically distributed to fund shareholders, rather than being realized by the fund itself. If you hold your index fund in a taxable account, you will be responsible for paying taxes on these capital gains when they are distributed to you.In summary, index investing can be a tax-efficient way to invest, but it is important to be aware of the potential for capital gains and to consider the tax implications of your investment strategy."]},

Buying a house comes with risks and expenses (repairs, maintenance, etc) and dealing with a student loan at the same time just makes it tougher. Personally, I would try to pay off at least a few of the loans first."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is generally a good idea to pay off any high-interest debt before taking on a large financial commitment like buying a house. This is because mortgage rates are usually lower than the interest rates on student loans and other types of debt, so it makes more financial sense to pay off the higher-interest debt first. Additionally, having a lower debt-to-income ratio can make it easier to qualify for a mortgage and potentially get a lower mortgage rate.That said, every person's financial situation is unique and there are other factors to consider when making this decision. For example, you may have other goals, such as saving for a down payment on a house or building up an emergency fund, that could take priority over paying off student loans. It's also important to make sure you have a good credit score and a stable income before taking on a mortgage.It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor or a mortgage lender to get a better understanding of your options and to develop a plan that works best for your individual circumstances."]},
{"question":"What is a call spread and how does it work?","human_answers":["A bullish (or 'long') call spread is actually two separate option trades.  The A\/B notation is, respectively, the strike price of each trade. The first 'leg' of the strategy, corresponding to B, is the sale of a call option at a strike price of B (in this case $165).  The proceeds from this sale, after transaction costs, are generally used to offset the cost of the second 'leg'. The second 'leg' of the strategy, corresponding to A, is the purchase of a call option at a strike price of A (in this case $145). Now, the important part: the payoff.  You can visualize it as so. This is where it gets a teeny bit math-y.  Below, P is the profit of the strategy, K1 is the strike price of the long call, K2 is the strike price of the short call, T1 is the premium paid for the long call option at the time of purchase, T2 is the premium received for the short call at the time of sale, and S is the current price of the stock.  For simplicity's sake, we will assume that your position quantity is a single option contract and transaction costs are zero (which they are not). P = (T2 - max(0, S - K2)) + (max(0, S - K1) - T1) Concretely, let's plug in the strikes of the strategy Nathan proposes, and current prices (which I pulled from the screen).  You have: P = (1.85 - max(0, 142.50 - 165)) - (max(0, 142.50 - 145)) = -$7.80 If the stock goes to $150, the payoff is -$2.80, which isn't quite break even -- but it may have been at the time he was speaking on TV. If the stock goes to $165, the payoff is $12.20. Please do not neglect the cost of the trades!  Trading options can be pretty expensive depending on the broker.  Had I done this trade (quantity 1) at many popular brokers, I still would've been net negative PnL even if NFLX went to >= $165."],"chatgpt_answers":["A call spread is a type of options strategy that involves purchasing call options at a specific strike price while also selling the same number of call options at a higher strike price. This strategy is also known as a \"bull call spread\" because it profits from a rise in the price of the underlying asset.Here's an example of how a call spread might work:Suppose you think that the price of XYZ stock is going to rise over the next few months. You could buy a call option with a strike price of $50, which gives you the right to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock at $50 per share any time before the option expires. This option might cost you $500.At the same time, you could also sell a call option with a strike price of $55, which gives someone else the right to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock from you at $55 per share any time before the option expires. This option might generate $300 in premium income for you.If the price of XYZ stock rises above $55 before the options expire, the person who bought the $55 call option from you can exercise their right to buy the stock from you at $55 per share. You would then use the $50 call option that you bought to buy the stock from the market at the lower price of $50 per share, and pocket the difference of $5 per share as profit.On the other hand, if the price of XYZ stock does not rise above $55 before the options expire, the $55 call option that you sold will expire worthless and you will keep the premium income as profit.Overall, the call spread strategy allows you to profit from a rise in the price of the underlying asset while limiting your potential loss to the difference between the strike prices of the options, minus the premium income that you received."]},
{"question":"ETF's for early retirement strategy","human_answers":["If your intention is to purchase ETFs on a regular basis (like $x per month), then ETFs may not make sense.

In a similar no load mutual fund, there are more likely to be no transaction costs (depending on how it is bought).   The above paragraph is not very definitive, and is really dependent upon how you would purchase either ETFs or Mutual funds.  For example if you have a Fidelity brokerage account, they may let you buy certain ETFs commission free.  Okay then either ETFs make great sense.  It would not make sense to buy ones that they charge $35 per transaction if you have regular transactions that are smallish. The last two questions seem to be asking if you should buy MF or buy stocks directly.  For most people the later is a losing proposition.  They do not have the time or ability to buy stocks directly, effectively.  Even if they did they may not have the capital to make enough of a difference when one considers all the cost involved.

Here are a few points to consider when using ETFs in an early retirement strategy:Diversification: ETFs can help you diversify your portfolio by investing in a basket of assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or a combination of these. This can help reduce risk by spreading your investments across different asset classes.Low costs: ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds, which means you'll pay less in fees. This can be especially important in an early retirement strategy, where you'll need to stretch your savings as far as possible.Flexibility: ETFs can be bought and sold like stocks, so you have the flexibility to adjust your investments as needed. This can be useful if you need to sell some of your investments to cover expenses during retirement.It's important to carefully consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when choosing an ETF for an early retirement strategy.

{"question":"Variations of Dual momentum","human_answers":["There's a few layers to the Momentum Theory discussed in that book. But speaking in general terms I can answer the following: Kind of. Assuming you understand that historically the Nasdaq has seen a little more volatility than the S&P. And, more importantly, that it tends to track the tech sector more than the general economy.  Thus the pitfall is that it is heavily weighted towards (and often tracks) the performance of a few stocks including: Apple, Google (Alphabet), Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and Amgen.  It could be argued this is counter intuitive to the general strategy you are trying to employ. This could be tougher to justify.  The reason it is potentially not a great idea has less to do with the fact that gold has factors other than just risk on\/off and inflation that affect its price (even though it does!); but more to do with the fact that it is harder to own gold and move in and out of positions efficiently than it is a bond index fund.   For example, consider buying physical gold.  To do so you have to spend some time evaluating the purchase, you are usually paying a slight premium above the spot price to purchase it, and you should usually also have some form of security or insurance for it.  So, it has additional costs.  Possibly worth it as part of a long-term investment strategy; if you believe gold will appreciate over a decade. But not so much if you are holding it for as little as a few weeks and constantly moving in and out of the position over the year. The same is true to some extent of investing in gold in the form of an ETF.  At least a portion of \"their gold\" comes from paper or futures contracts which must be rolled every month.  This creates a slight inefficiency.  While possibly not a deal breaker, it would not be as attractive to someone trading on momentum versus fundamentals in my opinion. In the end though, I think all strategies are adaptable.  And if you feel gold will be the big mover this year, and want to use it as your risk hedge, who am I or anyone else to tell you that you shouldn't."],"chatgpt_answers":["Dual momentum is a investment strategy that aims to combine the benefits of both absolute momentum and relative momentum in order to achieve better returns with lower volatility. It involves regularly rebalancing a portfolio between two asset classes: a risk-free asset, such as cash or short-term Treasury bonds, and a riskier asset, such as stocks or commodities.There are several variations of dual momentum that investors can use. Some common variations include:Absolute momentum: This version of dual momentum uses the absolute momentum of an asset, rather than its relative momentum compared to other assets, to determine when to buy and sell.Time-series momentum: This variation of dual momentum looks at the momentum of an asset over different time periods, rather than just the current period.Volatility-weighted dual momentum: This version of dual momentum uses the volatility of an asset as well as its momentum to determine when to buy and sell.Cross-sectional momentum: This variation of dual momentum looks at the momentum of different assets within a particular asset class, rather than comparing the momentum of different asset classes.Trend-following dual momentum: This version of dual momentum uses trend-following techniques, such as moving averages, to determine the direction of the market and when to buy and sell.It's important to note that dual momentum is just one investment strategy and may not be suitable for all investors.

{"question":"Stop paying VAT on digital sales when earnings are under \u00a381k","human_answers":["You can't currently avoid it. The reason the legislation was introduced was to prevent the big-name developers from setting up shop in a low-VAT country and selling apps to citizens of EU countries that would normally be paying a much higher VAT.  You need to register for VAT and file quarterly nil-returns so that you get that money back. It's a hassle, but probably worth it just to recoup those funds.  From an article in Kotaku from late 2014: You see, in the UK we have a rather sensible exemption on VAT for   businesses that earn under \u00a381,000 a year. This allows people to run   small businesses - like making and selling games in your spare time,   for instance - without the administrative nightmare of registering as   a business and paying VAT on sales. Unfortunately, none of the other   EU member states had an exemption like this, so when the new   legislation was being put together, there was no exemption factored   in. That means that if someone makes even \u00a31 from selling something   digital to another person in another EU country, they now have to be   VAT registered in the UK AND they have to pay tax on that sale at   whatever rate the buyer\u2019s country of residence has set. That could be   25% in Sweden, 21% in the Netherlands, and so on. [...] There\u2019s one piece of good news: even though anyone who sells digital   stuff now has to be VAT-registered in the UK, they don\u2019t actually have   to pay VAT on sales to people in the UK if they earn less than \u00a381,000   from it. (This concession was achieved earlier this month after   extensive lobbying.) But they\u2019ll still have to submit what\u2019s called a   \u201cnil-return\u201d, which is essentially a tax return with nothing on it,   every quarter in order to use the VAT MOSS service. That\u2019s a lot of   paperwork. Obviously Brexit may have a significant impact on all this, so the rules might change.  This is the official Google Link to how they've implemented this and for which countries it affects: https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/138000?hl=en  Due to VAT laws in the European Union (EU), Google is responsible for   determining, charging, and remitting VAT for all Google Play Store   digital content purchases by EU customers.

Even if you're not located in the EU, this change in VAT laws will   still apply."],"chatgpt_answers":["In the United Kingdom, VAT (Value Added Tax) is a tax that is applied to most goods and services sold in the country. If you are registered for VAT and your taxable supplies (sales) and acquisitions (purchases) from other EU countries are below the current VAT registration threshold, which is \u00a385,000, you do not need to register for VAT and you cannot charge VAT to your customers.However, if your taxable supplies and acquisitions are above the VAT registration threshold, you must register for VAT and charge VAT on your taxable supplies at the applicable rate. If you are registered for VAT and your taxable supplies are below the current deregistration threshold of \u00a383,000, you may be able to deregister for VAT.It's important to note that the VAT registration and deregistration thresholds may change periodically.

Rather than just 1 standard deduction, you get to deduct 2 standard deductions, you can double the max saved in an IRA, you benefit more from any non-refundable credits etc. This is partly due to the fact that when you are filing your taxes in Year 1, you can't include anything from Year 2 since it hasn't happened yet.

There are few ways I can think of that are more sure to cause home prices to plummet than to eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction. What about removing Student Loan Interest? Under a 30% 'simple' rate, what tools would the government use to encourage trade in specific areas? Will state income tax deduction also be removed? This is going to punish those in a state with a high income tax more than those in states without income tax. Those are all just 'common' deductions that affect a lot of people, you could easily say 'no' to all of them and just piss off a bunch of people, but what about selling stock though? I paid $100 for the stock and I sold it for $120, do I need to pay $36 tax on that because it is a 'simple' 30% tax rate or are we allowing the cost of goods sold deduction (it's called something else I believe when talking about stocks but it's the same idea?) What about if I travel for work to tutor individuals, can I deduct my mileage expenses? Do I need to pay 30% income tax on my earnings and principal from a Roth IRA? A lot of people have contributed to a Roth with the understanding that withdrawals will be tax free, changing those rules are punishing people for using vehicles intentionally created by the government.

It is a momentum indicator that compares the closing price of a security to its price range over a given time period. The indicator consists of two lines, %K and %D, that oscillate between 0 and 100. The %K line is the most important and it is usually depicted as a solid line, while the %D line is usually shown as a dotted line.The Stochastic Oscillator is used to identify potential overbought and oversold conditions in the market. When the %K line is above 80, the market is considered to be overbought, and when it is below 20, it is considered to be oversold. The %D line is a moving average of the %K line, and it is used to smooth out the fluctuations of the %K line.The Stochastic Oscillator can be used in conjunction with other technical indicators, such as trend lines and moving averages, to confirm trend changes and generate trading signals. It is also often used to identify divergences, which occur when the security's price is moving in a different direction than the indicator.Do you have any specific questions about the Stochastic Oscillator or how it is used in financial analysis?","The Stochastic Oscillator is a technical analysis indicator that compares the closing price of a security to its price range over a given period of time. It is typically used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market. The oscillator is calculated by taking the current closing price of a security and subtracting the low price for a given period of time. The result is then divided by the total price range for that period (the high price minus the low price) and multiplied by 100 to create a percentage. The resulting percentage is then plotted on a chart with values ranging from 0 to 100.Traders and analysts may look for crossovers above or below certain thresholds, such as the 80 and 20 levels, to identify potential buying or selling opportunities. Some traders may also look for divergences between the oscillator and the underlying security's price to identify potential trend reversals.

{"question":"Do I need another health insurance policy?","human_answers":["I understand that if I have multiple health insurance policies, I can only make claim from only one of them if ever I incur medical expenses (I'm from the Philippines). In the US, you cannot simultaneously submit a claim for payment of a medical bill, or request reimbursement for a bill already paid, to multiple insurance companies, but if you are covered by more  than one policy, then any part of a claim not paid by one company  can be submitted to another company that is also covering you.

For example, if the employer coverage pays 80% of your doctor's bill, the private insurance will pay the remaining 20%. But, the private  insurance policies are also quite expensive.  Some professional groups in the US offer major medical coverage to  their US members, and might be offering this to non-US members as well (though I suspect not).  These policies have large deductibles so that coverage kicks in only when the total medical expenses in that year (whether wholly or partially reimbursed, or not reimbursed at all) exceed the large deductible.  These types of policies actually pay out to only a few people - if you have more than, say, $20,000 of medical expenses in a year, you have been quite ill,  and thus the premiums are usually much smaller than full-fledged coverage  insurance policies which pay out much more frequently because of much smaller deductibles."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is generally a good idea to have health insurance to protect yourself and your family from the high costs of medical care.

{"question":"Are dividends the only thing linking stocks to corporate performance?","human_answers":["There is certainly an obligation in some cases of a company to distribute profit, either as dividend or a stock buy back.

Apple famously held out from doing either for years under Steve Jobs, and only in the last few years started doing both - a large dividend and a share buy-back which increases the value of remaining shares (as EPS then goes up with fewer shares out there).  Carl Icahn for example is one of those investors in Apple's case [and in many cases!] who put significant pressure, particularly when they were sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars. Ultimately, a (for-profit) corporation's board is tasked with maximizing its shareholder's wealth; as such, it can buy back shares, pay dividends, sell the company, liquidate the company, or expand the company, at its discretion, so long as it can justify to its shareholders that it is still attempting to maximize the value of their holdings.

{"question":"How does unemployment insurance work?","human_answers":["Unemployment insurance provides a temporary safety net to workers who lose their jobs by replacing a portion of their salary for certain periods. Each state administers its own unemployment insurance program so some rules may vary from state to state. To receive unemployment insurance payments, you must have lost your job through no fault of your own. If you quit your job or lost it because of poor performance or another justifiable reason, you are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. State unemployment insurance programs require claimants to have worked sufficiently before they can claim benefits. As soon as you apply for unemployment insurance, an agency with the state in which you live will verify that you were a victim of a layoff by contacting your previous employer and making sure you lost your job due to lack of work and not an action within your control. After the state verifies you were indeed the victim of a layoff, your weekly payment is calculated. Your payment will be a percentage of what you made in your previous job, generally between 20 percent and 50 percent, depending on your state. Unemployment insurance replaces only a portion of your previous pay because it is intended to pay only for the essentials of living such as food and utilities until you find new employment. Before you begin receiving benefits, you must complete a waiting period of typically one or two weeks. If you find a new job during this period, you will not be eligible for unemployment benefits, even if the job does not pay you as much as your previous job. After the waiting period, you will begin to receive your weekly payments. Employers pay for unemployment insurance through payroll taxes. So, while employees' work and earnings history are important to funding their unemployment benefits, the money does not come from their pay. Employer unemployment insurance contributions depend on several factors, including how many former employees have received benefits. Employers pay taxes on an employee's base wages, which vary by state. California, for example taxes employers on the first $7,000 of an employee's annual earnings, while neighboring Oregon taxes up to $32,000 of wages. Employers must set aside funds each payroll period and then report taxes and pay their states quarterly. States have several categories of tax rates they charge employers. New businesses and those first adding employees pay the \"new rate,\" which is typically lower and geared toward small businesses. Established businesses who haven't paid their taxes recently or properly are usually assessed the \"standard rate\" --- the highest possible tax rate, which in 2010 ranged from 5.4 percent in several states including Georgia, Hawaii and Alaska to 13.56 percent in Pennsylvania. Businesses in good standing may receive discounts under the \"experienced rate.\" Depending on the number of employees a business has and how many former employees have claimed unemployment, states can give sizable rate reductions. The fewer claims, the lower the rate a business pays in unemployment insurance taxes. As a result of the economic crisis legislation has been passed to extend Unemployment benefits.  Regular unemployment benefits are paid for a maximum of 26 weeks in most states. However, additional weeks of extended unemployment benefits are available during times of high unemployment. The unemployment extension legislation passed by Congress in February 2012 changed the way the tiers of Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) are structured. A tier of unemployment is an extension of a certain amount of weeks of unemployment benefits. There are currently four tiers of unemployment benefits. Each tier provides extra weeks of unemployment in addition to basic state unemployment benefits.

It's worth noting, however, that the specific reward rates and terms for each program can vary, so it's always a good idea to check with the store or refer to the program's terms and conditions to understand how your rewards will be earned.","Yes, it is possible to buy gift cards at a grocery store and receive a higher reward rate.

{"question":"Roth vs. Whole Insurance vs. Cash","human_answers":["Advantage of cash: You can spend the money without having to pay any fees or taxes to get it out. Disadvantage: When inflation is greater than zero, which it has been for many decades, your cash is continually losing value. Advantages of an IRA (Roth or classic): Your money will usually grow as the investments return a profit. You get special tax benefits. Disadvantages: There's risk -- you may lose money. There are tax penalties for withdrawing the money before retirement. In general, you should only put money in an IRA if you expect to leave it there until you retire. Or at least, for a long time. Whole life is a combination of a life insurance policy and an investment. Advantages: Combines insurance and investment into one convenient monthly payment. Disadvantages: The investment portion typically has lower returns than you could get elsewhere. If you have no need for life insurance -- if you're not supporting anyone or you're confidant they could get along without you or you don't like them and don't care what happens to them when you're gone or whatever -- then there's no point buying life insurance, whole or term. You're paying for a product that you don't need. It's pretty common advice to tell people that instead of buying a whole life policy, they should buy a term policy with the same coverage, and then invest the difference in the premium. For example, if you were considering getting a $100,000 whole life policy that costs $50 per month (just making up numbers, of course it depends on your age, health, etc), and you see you could get a $100,000 term life policy for $30 per month, you will almost certainly do better in the long run to buy the $30 term policy and put the other $20 into investments. The catch to this plan is that there are usually transaction costs to investing. Even a discount broker like Ameritrade or Scott Trade charges around $10 per transaction. So if you tried to invest $20 each month, you'd lose half of it to transaction fees. Which means that in practice, you'd have to save that money up until you had at least a few hundred. And at that point many people find other things always seem to come up to spend the money on, so that while they start out with every intention of investing this money, they don't."],"chatgpt_answers":["Roth vs. Traditional Insurance vs. Cash:Roth insurance: Roth insurance is a type of life insurance policy that is funded with after-tax dollars. This means that you pay taxes on the money you put into the policy, but the death benefit and any accumulated cash value are tax-free when you or your beneficiaries receive them.Traditional insurance: Traditional insurance is a type of life insurance policy that is funded with pre-tax dollars. This means that the premiums you pay for the policy are tax-deductible, but the death benefit and any accumulated cash value are taxable when you or your beneficiaries receive them.Cash: Cash refers to the physical currency that we use for everyday transactions. It can be in the form of paper bills or coins, or it can be in the form of electronic money that is stored in a bank account or on a debit or credit card.It's important to consider the tax implications of each of these options when deciding how to allocate your financial resources. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial planner or tax professional to help you determine the best course of action for your specific situation.","Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and whole life insurance are two different financial products that serve different purposes. A Roth IRA is a type of retirement savings account that allows you to contribute after-tax money and withdraw it tax-free in retirement. Whole life insurance is a type of life insurance that provides coverage for the entirety of the policyholder's life and also includes a savings component that can accumulate cash value over time.Roth IRAs and whole life insurance can both be useful financial tools, depending on your goals and circumstances. Here are some key differences between the two:Contributions: With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax money, which means you don't get an immediate tax deduction for your contributions. With whole life insurance, you pay premiums, which are a combination of the cost of insurance coverage and the savings component.Taxes: With a Roth IRA, any earnings on your contributions are tax-free as long as you meet certain requirements when you withdraw the money in retirement. With whole life insurance, the cash value component accumulates tax-deferred, but withdrawals may be subject to taxes and penalties.Investment options: With a Roth IRA, you have a wide range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. With whole life insurance, the cash value component is usually invested in a mix of fixed income and equities, and the investment options may be more limited.Purpose: The primary purpose of a Roth IRA is to save for retirement. The primary purpose of whole life insurance is to provide financial protection for your loved ones in the event of your death. However, the cash value component of whole life insurance can also be used as a savings and investment vehicle.Cash is a third option that is different from both Roth IRAs and whole life insurance. Cash is a liquid asset that can be used to make purchases, pay bills, or save for the future. It doesn't offer the potential for tax-free growth or the protection of insurance coverage, but it can be a useful tool for managing your finances and meeting your short-term and long-term goals."]},
{"question":"How does 83b election work when paying fair market value at time of grant?","human_answers":["The tax cost at election should be zero.  The appreciation is all capital gain beyond your basis, which will be the value at election. IRC \u00a783 applies to property received as compensation for services, where the property is still subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.  It will catch unvested equity given to employees. \u00a783(a) stops taxation until the substantial risk of forfeiture abates (i.e. no tax until stock vests) since the item is revocable and not yet truly income.  \u00a783(b) allows the taxpayer to make a quick election (up to 30 days after transfer - firm deadline!) to waive the substantial risk of forfeiture (e.g. treat shares as vested today). The normal operation of \u00a783 takes over after election and the taxable income is generally the value of the vested property minus the price paid for it.  If you paid fair market value today, then the difference is zero and your income from the shares is zero. The shares are now yours for tax purposes, though not for legal purposes.  That means they are most likely a capital asset in your hands, like other stocks you own or trade.  The shares will not be treated as compensation income on vesting, and vesting is not a tax matter for elected shares. If you sell them, you get capital gain (with tax dependent on your holding period) over a basis equal to FMV at the election.  The appreciation past election-FMV will be capital gain, rather than ordinary income.  This is why the \u00a783(b) election is so valuable.  It does not matter at this point whether you bought the restricted shares at FMV or at discount (or received them free) - that only affects the taxes upon \u00a783(b) election."],"chatgpt_answers":["A 83(b) election is a tax election that an individual who has received restricted stock may make to include the fair market value of the stock in their taxable income at the time the stock is received, rather than when the restrictions on the stock lapse.

{"question":"Bed and Breakfast, Same Day Capital Gains UK","human_answers":["The 'same day rule' in the UK is a rule for matching purposes only.  It says that sales on any day are matched firstly with purchases made on the same day for the purposes of ascertaining any gain\/loss. Hence the phrase 'bed-and-breakfast' ('b&b') when you wish to crystalise a gain (that is within the exempt amount) and re-establish a purchase price at a higher level.  You do the sale on one day, just before the market closes, which gets matched with your original purchase, and then you buy the shares back the next day, just after the market opens.  This is standard tax-planning.  Whenever you have a paper gain, and you wish to lock that gain out of being taxed, you do a bed-and-breakfast transaction, the idea being to use up your annual exemption each and every year.  Of course, if your dealing costs are high, then they may outweigh any tax saved, and so it would be pointless. For the purpose of an example, let's assume that the UK tax year is the same as the calendar year. Scenario 1. Suppose I bought some shares in 2016, for a total price of Stg.50,000. Suppose by the end of 2016, the holding is worth Stg.54,000, resulting in a paper gain of Stg.4,000. Question.  Should I do a b&b transaction to make use of my Stg.11,100 annual exemption ? Answer.  Well, with transaction costs at 1.5% for a round-trip trade, suppose, and stamp duty on the purchase of 0.5%, your total costs for a b&b will be Stg1,080, and your tax saved (upon some future sale date) assuming you are a 20% tax-payer is 20%x(4,000-1,080) = Stg584 (the transaction costs are deductible, we assume).  This does not make sense. Scenario 2. The same as scenario 1., but the shares are worth Stg60,000 by end-2016. Answer.  The total transaction costs are 2%x60,000 = 1,200 and so the taxable gain of 10,000-1,200 = 8,800 would result in a tax bill of 20%x8,800 = 1,760 and so the transaction costs are lower than the tax to be saved (a strict analysis would take into account only the present value of the tax to be saved), it makes sense to crystalise the gain.  We sell some day before the tax year-end, and re-invest the very next day. Scenario 3. The same as scenario 1., but the shares are worth Stg70,000 by end-2016. Answer.  The gain of 20,000 less costs would result in a tax bill for 1,500 (this is: 20%x(20,000 - 2%x70,000 - 11,100) ).  This tax bill will be on top of the dealing costs of 1,400.  But the gain is in excess of the annual exemption.  The strategy is to sell just enough of the holding to crystallise a taxable gain of just 11,100. The fraction, f%, is given by: f%x(70,000-50,000) - 2%xf%x70,000 = 11,100 ... which simplifies to: f% = 11,100\/18,600 = 59.68%. The tax saved is 20%x11,100 = 2,220, versus costs of 2%x59.58%x70,000 = 835.52. This strategy of partial b&b is adopted because it never makes sense to pay tax early !

{"question":"Car dealers offering lower prices when financing a used car","human_answers":["With new cars it's usually the other way around: finance at a low APR or get cash back when you buy it outright. With used cars you usually don't know how much they have invested in the car, so it's more difficult to know how low they're willing to go. Regardless, I do think it's odd that they would knock 2K off the price if you finance with them, but not if you pay cash. The only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2K in interest over the life of the loan, but they have no way of guaranteeing you won't refi. Therefore, I suspect they are bluffing and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check (or put the cash on the table) for 2K less.

This markup is how the dealership makes money on the financing of the car.By offering lower prices on used cars when financing through the dealership, the dealership is able to make up for the lower price by earning more money on the financing.

Short-term capital gains, which are gains on stocks held for one year or less, are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. Long-term capital gains, which are gains on stocks held for more than one year, are taxed at a lower rate.It's important to note that you may also be subject to taxes on your capital gains in India. However, the US has tax treaties with many countries, including India, that can help to avoid double taxation of the same income.

{"question":"Why are American-style options worth more than European-style options?","human_answers":["If you're into math, do this thought experiment: Consider the outcome X of a random walk process (a stock doesn't behave this way, but for understanding the question you asked, this is useful): On the first day, X=some integer X1. On each subsequent day, X goes up or down by 1 with probability 1\/2. Let's think of buying a call option on X. A European option with a strike price of S that expires on day N, if held until that day and then exercised if profitable, would yield a value Y = min(X[N]-S, 0). This has an expected value E[Y] that you could actually calculate. (should be related to the binomial distribution, but my probability & statistics hat isn't working too well today) The market value V[k] of that option on day #k, where 1 < k < N, should be V[k] = E[Y]|X[k], which you can also actually calculate. On day #N, V[N] = Y. (the value is known) An American option, if held until day #k and then exercised if profitable, would yield a value Y[k] = min(X[k]-S, 0).  For the moment, forget about selling the option on the market. (so, the choices are either exercise it on some day #k, or letting it expire) Let's say it's day k=N-1.  If X[N-1] >= S+1 (in the money), then you have two choices: exercise today, or exercise tomorrow if profitable. The expected value is the same. (Both are equal to X[N-1]-S). So you might as well exercise it and make use of your money elsewhere. If X[N-1] <= S-1 (out of the money), the expected value is 0, whether you exercise today, when you know it's worthless, or if you wait until tomorrow, when the best case is if X[N-1]=S-1 and X[N] goes up to S, so the option is still worthless. But if X[N-1] = S (at the money), here's where it gets interesting. If you exercise today, it's worth 0. If wait until tomorrow, there's a 1\/2 chance it's worth 0 (X[N]=S-1), and a 1\/2 chance it's worth 1 (X[N]=S+1). Aha! So the expected value is 1\/2. Therefore you should wait until tomorrow. Now let's say it's day k=N-2.  Similar situation, but more choices: If X[N-2] >= S+2, you can either sell it today, in which case you know the value = X[N-2]-S, or you can wait until tomorrow, when the expected value is also X[N-2]-S. Again, you might as well exercise it now. If X[N-2] <= S-2, you know the option is worthless. If X[N-2] = S-1, it's worth 0 today, whereas if you wait until tomorrow, it's either worth an expected value of 1\/2 if it goes up (X[N-1]=S), or 0 if it goes down, for a net expected value of 1\/4, so you should wait. If X[N-2] = S, it's worth 0 today, whereas tomorrow it's either worth an expected value of 1 if it goes up, or 0 if it goes down -> net expected value of 1\/2, so you should wait. If X[N-2] = S+1, it's worth 1 today, whereas tomorrow it's either worth an expected value of 2 if it goes up, or 1\/2 if it goes down (X[N-1]=S) -> net expected value of 1.25, so you should wait. If it's day k=N-3, and X[N-3] >= S+3 then E[Y] = X[N-3]-S and you should exercise it now; or if X[N-3] <= S-3 then E[Y]=0.  But if X[N-3] = S+2 then there's an expected value E[Y] of (3+1.25)\/2 = 2.125 if you wait until tomorrow, vs. exercising it now with a value of 2; if X[N-3] = S+1 then E[Y] = (2+0.5)\/2 = 1.25, vs. exercise value of 1; if X[N-3] = S then E[Y] = (1+0.5)\/2 = 0.75 vs. exercise value of 0; if X[N-3] = S-1 then E[Y] = (0.5 + 0)\/2 = 0.25, vs. exercise value of 0; if X[N-3] = S-2 then E[Y] = (0.25 + 0)\/2 = 0.125, vs. exercise value of 0. (In all 5 cases, wait until tomorrow.) You can keep this up; the recursion formula is E[Y]|X[k]=S+d = {(E[Y]|X[k+1]=S+d+1)\/2 + (E[Y]|X[k+1]=S+d-1) for N-k > d > -(N-k), when you should wait and see} or {0 for d <= -(N-k), when it doesn't matter and the option is worthless} or {d for d >= N-k, when you should exercise the option now}. The market value of the option on day #k should be the same as the expected value to someone who can either exercise it or wait. It should be possible to show that the expected value of an American option on X is greater than the expected value of a European option on X. The intuitive reason is that if the option is in the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be out of the money, the option should be exercised early  (or sold), something a European option doesn't allow, whereas if it is nearly at the money, the option should be held, whereas if it is out of the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be in the money, the option is definitely worthless. As far as real securities go, they're not random walks (or at least, the probabilities are time-varying and more complex), but there should be analogous situations. And if there's ever a high probability a stock will go down, it's time to exercise\/sell an in-the-money American option, whereas you can't do that with a European option. edit: ...what do you know: the computation I gave above for the random walk isn't too different conceptually from the Binomial options pricing model."],"chatgpt_answers":["American-style options are worth more than European-style options because they give the holder the right to exercise the option at any time before expiration, while European-style options can only be exercised at expiration. This means that American-style options have more flexibility and can potentially provide the holder with more value.For example, if an American-style option gives the holder the right to buy a stock at a certain price, and the price of the stock increases significantly before expiration, the holder can exercise the option and buy the stock at the agreed-upon price, even if the market price is higher. This allows the holder to potentially profit from the difference between the option price and the market price. In contrast, a holder of a European-style option would not be able to take advantage of the price increase until expiration, which may be too late.In general, the greater flexibility and potential value of American-style options make them more expensive than European-style options. However, it's important to note that the relative value of an option depends on a variety of factors, including the underlying stock or security, the option's strike price and expiration date, and market conditions.","American-style options are options that can be exercised at any time before expiration, while European-style options can only be exercised at expiration. Because American-style options give the holder more flexibility and the ability to take advantage of favorable price movements before expiration, they are typically worth more than European-style options.There are a few reasons for this. First, the holder of an American-style option has more time to take advantage of favorable price movements, which increases the option's value. Second, because the holder of an American-style option can exercise at any time, they are able to capture profits more quickly if the underlying asset's price moves in their favor. Finally, because the holder of an American-style option has more time and flexibility, they are able to better manage their risk, which also increases the option's value.It's important to note that the value of an option is determined by a variety of factors, including the underlying asset's price, the option's strike price, the option's expiration date, and the option's implied volatility. The relative value of American-style options compared to European-style options will depend on how these factors compare between the two options."]},
{"question":"Does SIPC protect securities purchased in foreign exchanges?","human_answers":["I have received a response from SIPC, confirming littleadv's answer: For a brief background, the protections available under the Securities   Investor Protection Act (\"SIPA\"), are only available in the context of   a liquidation proceeding of a SIPC member broker-dealer and relate to   the \"custody\" of securities and related cash at the SIPC member   broker-dealer. Thus, if a SIPC member broker-dealer were to fail at a   time when a customer had securities and\/or cash in the custody of the   SIPC member broker-dealer, in most instances it would be SIPC's   obligation to restore those securities and cash to the customer,   within statutory limits. That does not mean, however, that the   customer would necessarily receive the original value of his or her   purchase. Rather, the customer receives the security itself and\/or the   value of the customer's account as of the day that the liquidation   commenced. SIPC does not protect against the decline in value of any   security. In a liquidation proceeding under the SIPA, SIPC may advance   up to $500,000 per customer (including a $250,000 limit on cash in the   account). Please note that this protection only applies to the extent that you   entrust cash or securities to a U.S. SIPC member. Foreign broker   dealer subsidiaries are not SIPC members. However, to the extent that   any assets, including foreign securities, are being held by the U.S.   broker dealer, the assets are protected by SIPC.

To improve your score, make sure to pay all of your bills on time, reduce your credit card balances, and avoid applying for new credit unnecessarily.Save for a down payment: Lenders may be more willing to lend to you if you can make a larger down payment, as it shows that you have some financial stability. Try to save as much as you can for a down payment, as a larger down payment can also help you qualify for a lower interest rate on your mortgage.Get pre-approved for a mortgage: Before you start shopping for a home, it can be helpful to get pre-approved for a mortgage. This will give you an idea of how much you can borrow and what kind of interest rate you can expect.Consider government-backed loans: FHA loans, VA loans, and USDA loans are all government-backed mortgage programs that may be more forgiving of past credit issues. These programs often have lower down payment requirements and may be more likely to approve a loan for someone who has recently gone through bankruptcy.Be prepared to pay a higher interest rate: Because bankruptcy is considered a high-risk financial event, you may be required to pay a higher interest rate on your mortgage.

Some common methods for calculating portfolio risk include the use of variance, standard deviation, and value at risk (VaR). These measures provide a quantitative estimate of the potential losses that could occur over a given time period, based on the historical performance of the portfolio.It is also important to consider other factors that can impact portfolio risk, such as the investor's time horizon, the level of liquidity in the portfolio, and the potential for correlation between the assets in the portfolio.

{"question":"How to stress test an investment plan?","human_answers":["Here are a few things I've already done, and others reading this for their own use may want to try.  It is very easy to find a pattern in any set of data. It is difficult to find a pattern that holds true in different data pulled from the same population.  Using similar logic, don't look for a pattern in the data from the entire population. If you do, you won't have anything to test it against. If you don't have anything to test it against, it is difficult to tell the difference between a pattern that has a cause (and will likely continue) and a pattern that comes from random noise (which has no reason to continue). If you lose money in bad years, that's okay. Just make sure that the gains in good years are collectively greater than the losses in bad years. If you put $10 in and lose 50%, you then need a 100% gain just to get back up to $10.  A Black Swan event (popularized by Nassim Taleb, if memory serves) is something that is unpredictable but will almost certainly happen at some point. For example, a significant natural disaster will almost certainly impact the United States (or any other large country) in the next year or two. However, at the moment we have very little idea what that disaster will be or where it will hit.  By the same token, there will be Black Swan events in the financial market. I do not know what they will be or when they will happen, but I do know that they will happen. When building a system, make sure that it can survive those Black Swan events (stay above the death line, for any fellow Jim Collins fans). Recreate your work from scratch. Going through your work again will make you reevaluate your initial assumptions in the context of the final system. If you can recreate it with a different medium (i.e. paper and pen instead of a computer), this will also help you catch mistakes."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several ways to stress test an investment plan:Conduct a sensitivity analysis: This involves evaluating how changes in certain variables, such as interest rates or market performance, would impact the expected returns of the investment plan.

We had a question a couple weeks ago where someone, like you, took some friend's money to trade with but didn't know how to give the money back or calculate the net-return.  It is not smart to take and invest other people's money when you have zero industry experience and when you do not understand the legal requirements of handling someone else's money. Within the first 12 months of my brokerage account I had returned something like 150%, I doubled my money plus a bit.  The next year was something like -20%; if I remember correctly the next year was worse, then up again for year four.  Year 1 I thought I was a genius and had figured this whole thing out, year 2 put me in my place and year 3 kicked me while I was down. You have 6 months of pretty solid returns, good for you.  I don't think that means it's time to set up shop.  Really, I think you need to sit down and think long and hard about the implications, legal and otherwise, of holding other people's money.  Running a fund is significantly different than trading your own money.   Retail investors don't, typically, have a good memory.  Great, you made me 17% last year, and 25% the year before but right now I'm down 10%, so give me my money back because I would have been better off in an savings account this year.    This is why index funds are in vogue right now.  Lots of people have had money in active funds that have trailed or matched the \"safe and passive\" index funds, so they're angry.  Retail folks get jittery the instant they lose money, no matter how much.  You need to be ready to contend with \"What have you done for me lately?\" the instant something turns negative, no matter how positive your returns have been. At your stage in the game you should get a job and continue putting your own money in to your own system and be ready to lose some of it.

In addition, you may qualify for one or more waivers on a potential underpayment penalty when you file your Form 1040 even if you don't make an estimated payment, and you may reduce or eliminate any penalty by annualizing your income - which is to say breaking it down by quarter rather than the full year.

The specific tax treatment of your stock grant depends on the type of grant you receive and the rules that apply to it.Here is a brief overview of how different types of stock grants are taxed:Stock options: Stock options give you the right to buy a specific number of shares of your company's stock at a fixed price (also known as the strike price) at some point in the future. If you exercise your stock options, you will typically be required to pay taxes on the difference between the strike price and the fair market value of the stock at the time you exercise the options. This difference is known as the \"bargain element.\" The bargain element is generally considered to be taxable as ordinary income, and you will be required to pay taxes on it when you exercise your options.Restricted stock units (RSUs): RSUs are a type of stock grant that gives you the right to receive a specific number of shares of your company's stock at a future date. You may be required to pay taxes on the value of the RSUs when they vest (i.e., when you become entitled to receive the stock). The value of the RSUs at vesting is generally considered to be taxable as ordinary income.Employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs): ESPPs are a type of stock purchase plan that allows you to purchase your company's stock at a discounted price.

{"question":"Dad paying for my new home in cash. How can I buy the house from him?","human_answers":["There are quite some options, but without additional information, I can only provide examples. Last year I had the option to buy a house, but I decided against it because in my area it is getting harder and harder every year to sell it at a reasonable price. But if I had bought a house, my mother would have lent me the money, with me paying it back to her over the years on 3% interest. So it would have been some kind of a private loan. But my mom would never have taken ownership of the house, since it was not her intention to own it in any way. (Does your dad intend to own the house and rent it to you? If yes, and if you are comfortable with renting instead of buying, then this is an option.) The second option, the one we discarded because of the additional cost, is that I could have taken a loan, paying 4.5% interest to the bank, which would then pay under 1% to my mom, and keep the rest. Banks always want to make profit, and this profit has to come from somewhere - from the difference between the interest rates. If your dad has 230k on the bank, and you owe 230k to the bank, you are better off if you keep the bank out - at least as long as your dad is comfortable with lending you money, and you are comfortable with owing him money. (my gf would never borough money from her mother, because her mother would always play the \"you are in my debt\" card - on each and every visit, and whenever she needed help in any way...)

This can be a good option if you have good credit and can qualify for a mortgage with a favorable interest rate.Use a land contract: Another option is to use a land contract, also known as a contract for deed.

A promissory note is a written promise to pay a certain amount of money at a specific time or on demand. You could use a promissory note to outline the terms of the sale, including the purchase price, the payment schedule, and any late payment fees.Regardless of which option you choose, it is important to have a written agreement in place to document the terms of the sale and protect both you and your father's interests.

{"question":"Steps to buying a home","human_answers":["Pre-edit, Pete mentioned that he feels real estate agents would (a) like you to buy as much house as you afford, and (b) would love to show you three houses and have you choose one.  As a real estate agent myself, I believe his warnings were understated. As with any industry, there are good and bad people. Agents are paid to move houses. If the median US home is under $200K, and commissions average say 5%, the $10,000 to be gained is split between the buyer brokerage and selling agent. The $5000 to each is then shared with 'the house.' So, this sale would net me $2500, gross. Move one a week, and the income is great, one per month, not so much. Tire kickers will waste an agent's time for a potential decision to wait another year and continue renting. Their obligation is to tell you the truth, but not to offer financial advice.  Remember the mortgage crisis? It seems the banks and brokers aren't watching out for you either. They will tell you what they'll lend you, but not what you can afford. These numbers are worlds apart.  I strongly recommend a 20% downpayment. The FHA PMI calculator shows that a 90% LTV (i.e. a 10% downpayment) for a $100K house will cost you $1200\/yr in PMI. Think about this. For the $10,000 that you didn't put down, you are paying an extra $1200 each year. This is on top of the interest, so even at 5%, that last $10,000 is costing nearly 17%. If you can't raise that $10K (or whatever 10% is on that house) in cheaper funds, you should hold off. Using the 401(k) loan for this purpose is appropriate, yet emotionally charged. As if suck loans are written by the devil himself.  \"Buy the biggest house you can\"? No. I have a better idea. Buy the smallest place you can tolerate. I have a living room (in addition to family room) that has been used 3 times in 20 years. A dining room we actually use. Twice per year. When your house is 50% too big, you pay 50% more property tax, more utility bills, and more maintenance. Closing costs, commission, etc, isn't cheap, but the lifetime cost of living in a too-big house is a money pit."],"chatgpt_answers":["Buying a home can be a complex process, but it can also be a very exciting and fulfilling experience.

It may also be helpful to get pre-approved for a mortgage, which will give you a better idea of how much you can borrow.Find a real estate agent: A real estate agent can help you navigate the process of buying a home, from finding properties that meet your needs to negotiating the final sale. Consider finding an agent who has experience in the area where you want to buy and who you feel comfortable working with.Start looking for homes: You can start by looking online for homes that meet your criteria, such as location, price range, and number of bedrooms and bathrooms. You can also drive around neighborhoods that you are interested in and look for \"for sale\" signs. Your real estate agent can also help you find homes that meet your needs.Make an offer: Once you have found a home that you want to buy, you will need to make an offer to the seller. Your real estate agent can help you determine a fair offer price based on comparable homes in the area. The seller will either accept, reject, or counter your offer.Get a home inspection: Before you finalize the purchase of the home, it's a good idea to have a professional home inspector check the condition of the property. The home inspector will look for any issues with the home, such as structural problems or problems with the plumbing or electrical systems.Get a mortgage: If you haven't already done so, you will need to get a mortgage to finance the purchase of the home.

This means that you will apply for a mortgage loan and a lender will review your financial situation and credit history to determine how much they are willing to lend you.

They can help you find properties that meet your criteria, negotiate with sellers on your behalf, and handle the paperwork and other details of the transaction. It's a good idea to interview a few agents and choose one that you feel comfortable working with.Search for homes: Once you have a budget, a mortgage pre-approval, and a real estate agent, you can start searching for homes. You can use online listings, attend open houses, and work with your agent to identify potential properties. Be sure to consider location, size, condition, and any other factors that are important to you.Make an offer: When you find a home that you want to buy, you will need to make an offer to the seller. This will involve specifying the price you are willing to pay, as well as any contingencies (such as a home inspection or financing) that are part of the offer. Your real estate agent can help you craft an offer that is competitive, while also considering your budget and other factors.Negotiate: After you make an offer, the seller may counter with a different price or terms. This is where the negotiation process begins. You and the seller will work with your respective agents to come to an agreement on the final sale price and other terms of the transaction.Get a home inspection: Before you finalize the purchase of a home, it is a good idea to have a professional home inspection done. This will help you identify any potential issues with the property, such as structural damage or needed repairs. The inspector will provide you with a report detailing their findings, and you can use this information to negotiate with the seller or make a decision about whether to proceed with the purchase.Finalize the mortgage and close the sale: Once you have agreed on the sale price and any contingencies have been satisfied, it is time to finalize the mortgage and close the sale. This will involve signing a mortgage agreement and paying any closing costs or other fees associated with the transaction.

{"question":"How can my dad (grandpa) transfer shares to my 2 year old son?","human_answers":["A UTMA may or may not fit your situation. The main drawbacks to a UTMA account is that it will count against your child for financial aid (it counts as the child's asset). The second thing to consider is that taxes aren't deferred like in a 529 plan. The last problem of course is that when he turns 18 he gets control of the account and can spend the money on random junk (which may or may not be important to you). A 529 plan has a few advantages over a UTMA account. The grandparents can open the account with your son as the beneficiary and the money doesn't show up on financial aid for college (under current law which could change of course). Earnings grow tax free which will net you more total growth. You can also contribute substantially more without triggering the gift tax ~$60k. Also many states provide a state tax break for contributing to the state sponsored 529 plan. The account owner would be the grandparents so junior can't spend the money on teenage junk.

If your dad wants to transfer shares to your son, he will need to do so through a legal mechanism, such as a trust or a custodial account.There are two main options for transferring shares to a minor child: setting up a custodial account or setting up a trust.A custodial account is a type of account that is set up for the benefit of a minor child and is managed by an adult, known as the custodian. The custodian has the legal authority to make investment decisions on behalf of the child and has a fiduciary duty to manage the assets in the best interests of the child. The child becomes the owner of the assets in the account when they reach the age of majority, which is typically 18 or 21, depending on state law.A trust is a legal arrangement in which a person (the grantor) transfers assets to a trust and appoints a trustee to manage the assets for the benefit of a beneficiary. A trust can be set up to hold assets for the benefit of a minor child, and the trustee has a legal obligation to manage the assets in the trust in the best interests of the child. The child becomes the owner of the assets in the trust when they reach the age of majority or when the trust terms specify.It is important to consult with a lawyer or financial advisor to determine the best option for transferring shares to a minor child and to ensure that the transfer is done in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.","There are a few steps that your dad (grandpa) can take to transfer shares to your 2 year old son. Here is a general outline of the process:Determine the value of the shares: Your dad will need to determine the value of the shares that he wants to transfer to your son. This will help him determine the tax implications of the transfer.Consult with a financial advisor: It is a good idea for your dad to consult with a financial advisor or attorney before making any decisions about transferring shares. They can help him understand the tax implications of the transfer and provide guidance on the best way to proceed.Set up a trust: If your son is too young to hold the shares directly, your dad may want to set up a trust for him. This will allow the trust to hold the shares on behalf of your son until he is old enough to manage them himself. Your dad will need to name a trustee to manage the trust and ensure that the assets in the trust are used for the benefit of your son.Transfer the shares: Once your dad has determined the value of the shares and set up a trust, if necessary, he can then transfer the shares to your son. This can typically be done through a transfer of ownership form, which will need to be completed and signed by your dad. The transfer may also need to be approved by the company whose shares are being transferred.It's important to note that transferring shares can have tax implications, so it is a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or attorney to ensure that the transfer is done in a way that is tax-efficient and in the best interests of your son."]},
{"question":"If I invest in securities denominated in a foreign currency, should I hedge my currency risk?","human_answers":["So far we have a case for yes and no.  I believe the correct answer is... maybe. You mention that most of your expenses are in dollars which is definitely correct, but there is an important complication that I will try to simplify greatly here.  Many of the goods you buy are priced on the international market (a good example is oil) or are made from combinations of these goods.  When the dollar is strong the price of oil is low but when the dollar is weak the price of oil is high. However, when you buy stuff like services (think a back massage) then you pay the person in dollars and the person you are paying just wants dollars so the strength of the dollar doesn't really matter. Most people's expenses are a mix of things that are priced internationally and locally with a bias toward local expenses.  If they also have a mix of investments some of which are international and depend on the strength of the dollar and some are domestic and do not, then they don't have to worry much about the strength\/weakness of the dollar later when they sell their investments and buy what they want.  If the dollar is weak than the international goods will be more expensive, but at the same time international part of their portfolio will be worth more. If you plan on retiring in a different country or have 100% of your investments in emerging market stocks than it is worth thinking about either currency hedging or changing your investment mix.  However, for many people a good mix of domestic and international investments covers much of the risk that their currency will weaken while offering the benefits of diversification.  The best part is you don't need to guess if the dollar will get stronger or weaker. tl;dr: If you want your portfolio to not depend on currency moves then hedge.  If you want your retirement to not depend on currency moves then have a good mix of local and unhedged international investments."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is generally a good idea to hedge currency risk when investing in securities denominated in a foreign currency.

{"question":"When is an IPO considered failure? ","human_answers":["Just skimming through the Wikipedia article on airberlin, I notice there is more to the story than simply \"airberlin's IPO failed, so they postponed it and did it anyways.\" 3 points to keep in mind about IPOs:  1) An IPO is the mechanism for taking a private company and setting it up for shares to be owned by \"the public\".  2) The process of selling shares to the public often allows original owners and\/or early investors to \"cash out\". Most countries (including member nations of the EU) limit some transactions like pre-IPO companies to \"accredited investors\".  3) Selling shares to the public also can allow the company to access more funds for growth. This is particularly important in a capital-intensive business like an airline; new B737-MAX costs >$110M. New A320neo costs >$105M USD.  Ultimately, the question of a successful IPO depends on how you define success. Initially, there was a lot of concern that the IPO was set up with too much focus on goal #2... allowing the management & owners to cash out.  It looks like the first approach was not meeting good opinions in the market during 2006. A major concern was that the initial approach focused on management only cashing out its shares and no money actually going to the company to support its future.  The investment bankers restructured the IPO, including the issuance of more new shares so that more $ could end up in the company's accounts, not just in the accounts of the management.  If anything, it's still a pretty successful IPO given that the shares were successfully listed, the company collected the money it needed to invest and grow, and the management still cashed out."],"chatgpt_answers":["An initial public offering (IPO) is generally considered a failure if the stock price falls significantly below the offering price on the first day of trading and remains low in the following weeks or months. This can indicate that there was insufficient demand for the company's stock or that investors have lost confidence in the company's prospects.However, it's important to note that the performance of a company's stock in the immediate aftermath of an IPO is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the company's long-term success. Many successful companies have experienced a drop in their stock price after going public, only to see their stock price recover and rise over time. Conversely, a company's stock may initially perform well after an IPO but later decline due to various factors such as changes in market conditions or the company's financial performance.It's also worth noting that an IPO is just one way for a company to raise capital and is not necessarily the best option for every company.

You should be able to trade those funds.  I've never heard of a broker charging margin interest on unsettled funds, but that doesn't mean there isn't a broker somewhere that does. Brokers are allowed to impose their own restrictions, however, since margin is basically offering you a line of credit.  You should check to see if your broker has more restrictive rules. I'd guess that you may have heard about restrictions that apply to cash accounts and think they may also apply to margin accounts.  If that's the case and you want to learn more about the rules generally, try searching for these terms: You should be able to find a lot of clear resources on those terms.  Here's one that's current and provides examples: https:\/\/www.fidelity.com\/learning-center\/trading-investing\/trading\/avoiding-cash-trading-violations On a margin account you avoid these issue because the margin (essentially a loan from your broker) provides a cushion \/ additional funds that avoid the issues.

The settlement period is the length of time it takes for this process to be completed.In the United States, the settlement period for most trades is typically three business days after the trade is executed, which is known as T+3. This means that if you buy a security on Monday, the settlement will occur on Thursday. During this time, the seller is required to deliver the security to the buyer, and the buyer is required to pay the seller for the security.Traders often have to consider the settlement period when making trades, as they need to have sufficient settled funds available in their account to cover the purchase or sufficient unsettled funds from a previous sale to cover the sale. If a trader does not have sufficient settled or unsettled funds, they may not be able to complete the trade.It's important to note that the settlement period may vary depending on the type of security and the jurisdiction in which the trade takes place. In some cases, the settlement period may be shorter or longer than T+3. It's always a good idea to check the settlement period for a specific security before making a trade.","In the financial industry, the term \"T+3\" refers to the settlement date of a trade, which is the date on which the exchange of funds and securities for a transaction is completed. In the case of T+3, the settlement date is three business days after the trade date.In the United States, most stock trades are settled on a T+3 basis. This means that when you buy or sell a stock, the trade is considered to be complete on the third business day after the trade date. For example, if you place an order to buy a stock on Monday, the trade will be settled on Thursday.During the settlement period, the buyer's brokerage firm must deliver the funds to pay for the securities, and the seller's brokerage firm must deliver the securities to the buyer. The actual transfer of the securities and funds may occur through a clearinghouse, which acts as a intermediary between the two firms to facilitate the exchange.It's important to note that when you place a trade, the funds used for the transaction may not be immediately available for use in other trades or for withdrawal. This is because the trade has not yet settled, and the funds are considered to be \"unsettled\" until the settlement date.Once the trade has settled, the funds will become \"settled\" and will be available for use. It's important to manage your settled and unsettled funds carefully, as using unsettled funds to make additional trades can lead to issues with your brokerage account."]},
{"question":"Why was my Credit Limit Increase Denied?","human_answers":["The bottom line is that you are kind of a terrible customer for them.   Granted you are far better than one that does not pay his bills, but you are (probably) in the tier right above that. Rewards cards are used to lure the unorganized into out of control interest rates and late payments.  These people are Capital One's, and others, best customers.  They have traded hundreds of dollars in interest payments for a couple of dollars in rewards.  The CC company says:  \"YUMMY\"! You, on the other hand, cut into their \"meager\" profits from fees collected from your transactions.  Why should they help you make more money?  Why should they further cut into your profits? Response to comment: Given your comment I think the bottom line is a matter of perspective.  You seem like a logical, altruistic type person who probably seeks a win-win situation in business dealings.  This differs from CC companies they operate to seek one thing:  enslavement. BTW the \"terrible customer\" remark should be taken as a compliment.   After you get past the marketing lies you begin to see what reward programs and zero percent financing is all about.  How do most people end up with 21%+ interest rates?  They started with a zero percent balance loan, and was late for a payment. Reward cards work a bit differently.  Studies show that people tend to spend about 17% more when they use a reward card.  I've caught myself ordering an extra appetizer or beer and have subsequently stopped using a reward card for things I can make a decision at the time of purchase.  For people with tight budgets this leads to debt. My \"meager\" profits paragraph makes sense when you understand the onerous nature of CC companies.  They are not interested in earning 2% on purchases (charge 3% and give back 1%) for basically free money.  You rightly see this as what should be a win-win for all parties involved.  Thus the meager in quotation marks.  CC companies are willing to give back 1% and charge 3% if you then pay 15% or more on your balance. Some may disagree with me on the extracting nature of CC companies, but they are wrong.

Here are a few possibilities:Your credit score is too low: Credit card issuers generally consider a borrower's credit score when deciding whether to increase their credit limit. If your credit score is too low, the issuer may decide that you are too risky to lend more money to.You have too much debt: If you already have a lot of debt, the issuer may be concerned that you will not be able to pay back any additional credit they provide.You have a recent late payment: If you have recently missed a payment or have a history of late payments, the issuer may be concerned about your ability to make timely payments on a larger credit limit.Your income is too low: Credit card issuers may consider your income when deciding whether to increase your credit limit. If your income is low, the issuer may decide that you cannot afford to take on more credit.You have a history of maxing out your credit cards: If you have a history of maxing out your credit cards, the issuer may be concerned that you will do the same with a higher credit limit.You have recently opened a lot of new credit accounts: If you have recently opened a lot of new credit accounts, the issuer may be concerned that you are taking on too much debt and may not be able to manage your finances effectively.It's important to note that credit card issuers do not have to disclose the specific reason they denied your credit limit increase request.

{"question":"Ways to establish credit history for international student","human_answers":["There's an excellent new service called SelfScore that offers US credit cards to international students. They work with students without a credit history and even without an SSN by using other qualifying factors such as major, financial resources in their home country, and employability upon graduation. Worth clarifying: it's neither a secured credit card nor a prepaid card. It's a proper US credit card with no annual fees and a relatively low APR designed to help students build US credit. The spending limit is relatively small but that probably doesn't matter for just building a credit history."],"chatgpt_answers":["As an international student, it can be difficult to establish a credit history in a new country. However, there are a few steps you can take to try to build your credit:Get a credit card: Many credit card companies offer credit cards specifically for students or for people with little or no credit history. These cards often have lower credit limits and higher interest rates, but they can help you start building your credit by allowing you to make small purchases and pay them off each month.Become an authorized user on someone else's credit card: If you have a parent, spouse, or other trusted person with a good credit history, you may be able to become an authorized user on their credit card. This means that you can use the card to make purchases, but the primary cardholder is responsible for paying the bills. Your credit history will be linked to the primary cardholder's account, so their good credit history can help boost yours.Use a credit-builder loan: A credit-builder loan is a small loan that is specifically designed to help people build their credit. You borrow a small amount of money, which is deposited into a savings account. You then make regular payments on the loan, and once it is paid off, you receive the money in the savings account. This can help you demonstrate that you are able to borrow money responsibly and make regular payments on time.Rent an apartment or open utility accounts: If you are able to rent an apartment or open utility accounts in your own name, these actions can help you build your credit. Make sure to pay your bills on time and in full each month to establish a good payment history.Consider a secured credit card: A secured credit card is a type of credit card that requires you to put down a security deposit. The credit limit on the card is typically equal to the amount of the deposit. While these cards may have higher fees than traditional credit cards, they can be a good option for international students who are trying to build their credit.It's important to remember that building credit takes time, so be patient and focus on using credit responsibly."]},

{"question":"Should I trade in a car I own to lower my payments on a new lease?","human_answers":["Trade-in values are generally below what you can get in a private sale. To directly answer your question, you should sell the crossover yourself and use the balance to purchase your new vehicle. I would encourage you to use the $9k to finance directly without a lease, especially if you are planning on financing after the lease term. The lease will not save you money over the time you drive the vehicle in this case, and worse, will likely expose you to risk of having to pay additional fees if you break certain terms in the lease (mileage, wear and tear, etc) Best option mathematically is to use the $9k to purchase a vehicle for cash. This provides the lowest total cost of ownership.  Even if you are afraid of purchasing a lemon, leasing a vehicle is awfully expensive insurance against that possibility. You would have to rack up some significant repairs to justify the cost of the lease vs cash over the term of operating the vehicle."],"chatgpt_answers":["It's generally a good idea to consider whether trading in a car you own would be beneficial when you're considering leasing a new vehicle.

{"question":"Do credit ratings (by Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) have any relevance?","human_answers":["I like Muro questions! No, I don't think they do.

These opinions are based on the credit rating agencies' analysis of the borrower's or issuer's financial condition, including factors such as the borrower's or issuer's ability to make timely payments on its debts and its overall level of indebtedness.Credit ratings can be relevant for a variety of reasons. For example, lenders, investors, and other market participants may use credit ratings as a reference point when deciding whether to lend money to a borrower or invest in a security.

{"question":"Bond ETFs as a means to achieve risk parity","human_answers":["How is it possible that long term treasury bonds, which the government has never defaulted on, can hold more risk as an ETF then the stock market index? The risk from long-term bonds isn't that the government defaults, but that interest rates go up before you get paid, so investors want bonds issued more recently at higher interest rates, rather than your older bonds that pay at a lower rate (so the price for your bonds goes down). This is usually caused by higher inflation rates which reduce the value of the interest that you will be paid. Do you assume more risk investing in bond ETFs than you would investing in individual bonds? If you are choosing the right ETFs, there should be a lower amount of risk because the ETFs are taking care of the difficult work of buying a variety of bonds.  Are bond ETFs an appropriate investment vehicle for risk diversification? Yes, if you are investing in bonds, exchange traded funds are an appropriate way to buy them. The markets for ETFs are usually very liquid."],"chatgpt_answers":["Bond ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are investment vehicles that track the performance of a specific bond market index, such as the Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index or the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index. Bond ETFs can be an effective way to achieve risk parity in an investment portfolio because they provide exposure to the bond market, which tends to be less volatile than the stock market. By including bond ETFs in a portfolio, an investor can diversify their portfolio and potentially reduce the overall risk of the portfolio.Risk parity is an investment strategy that aims to achieve a balanced allocation of risk across different asset classes in a portfolio, rather than focusing on maximizing returns. This can be achieved by allocating a greater proportion of the portfolio to asset classes with lower risk, such as bonds, and a smaller proportion to asset classes with higher risk, such as stocks. By doing so, the portfolio is less likely to experience large losses in the event of a market downturn.It is important to note that while bond ETFs can help to reduce the overall risk of a portfolio, they are not risk-free and the value of bond ETFs can still fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit conditions.

{"question":"What's the folly with this stock selection strategy","human_answers":["You are probably going to hate my answer, but... If there was an easy way to ID stocks like FB that were going to do what FB did, then those stocks wouldn't exist and do that because they would be priced higher at the IPO. The fact is there is always some doubt, no one knows the future, and sometimes value only becomes clear with time. Everyone wants to buy a stock before it rises right? It will only be worth a rise if it makes more profit though, and once it is established as making more profit the price will be already up, because why wouldn't it be? That means to buy a real winner you have to buy before it is completely obvious to everyone that it is going to make more profit in the future, and that means stock prices trade at speculative prices, based on expected future performance, not current or past performance. Now I'm not saying past and future performance has nothing in common, but there is a reason that a thousand financially oriented websites quote a disclaimer like \"past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance\". Now maybe this is sort of obvious, but looking at your image, excluding things like market capital that you've not restricted, the PE ratio is based on CURRENT price and PAST earnings, the dividend yield is based on PAST publications of what the dividend will be and CURRENT price, the price to book is based on PAST publication of the company balance sheet and CURRENT price, the EPS is based on PAST earnings and the published number of shares, and the ROI and net profit margin in based on published PAST profits and earnings and costs and number of shares. So it must be understood that every criteria chosen is PAST data that analysts have been looking at for a lot longer than you have with a lot more additional information and experience with it. The only information that is even CURRENT is the price. Thus, my ultimate conclusive point is, you can't based your stock picks on criteria like this because it's based on past information and current stock price, and the current stock price is based on the markets opinion of relative future performance. The only way to make a good stock pick is understand the business, understand its market, and possibly understand world economics as it pertains to that market and business. You can use various criteria as an initial filter to find companies and investigate them, but which criteria you use is entirely your preference. You might invest only in profitable companies (ones that make money and probably pay regular dividends), thus excluding something like an oil exploration company, which will just lose money, and lose it, and lose some more, forever... unless it hits the jackpot, in which case you might suddenly find yourself sitting on a huge profit. It's a question of risk and preference. Regarding your concern for false data. Google defines the Return on investment (TTM) (%) as: Trailing twelve month Income after taxes divided by the average (Total Long-Term Debt + Long-Term Liabilities + Shareholders Equity), expressed as a percentage.

{"question":"Taxation from variations in currency","human_answers":["According to the answers to this question, you generally aren't taxed on gains until you sell the asset in question. None of those answered specifically for the U.K., so perhaps someone else will be able to weigh in on that. To apply those ideas to your question, yes your gains and losses are taxable. If you originally traded something worth $100 for the bitcoins, then when you converted back to dollars you received $200, you would have a $100 gain, simply on the foreign exchange trade. That is, this $100 of income is in addition to any income you made from your business (selling goods)."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a few different ways that variations in currency can affect taxation. One way is through the conversion of foreign income into the taxpayer's domestic currency. For example, if an individual earns income in a foreign currency and then converts that income into their domestic currency for tax reporting purposes, any changes in the exchange rate between the two currencies can affect the amount of income that is subject to tax.Another way that currency variations can affect taxation is through the taxation of transactions involving foreign currencies. For example, if an individual buys or sells a foreign currency as an investment, any gains or losses from the transaction may be subject to tax. The tax treatment of these transactions can depend on the specific tax laws of the individual's jurisdiction and the nature of the transaction (e.g., whether it is considered a capital gain or business income).It is also worth noting that some countries have specific rules and regulations related to the taxation of foreign currency transactions. For example, some countries may require taxpayers to report their foreign currency transactions on their tax returns or to file separate tax forms for these transactions.

Dividends are typically paid out on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually, and can provide a source of income for investors who hold the stock.To identify dividend stocks, you can look for companies that have a history of paying dividends and that have a strong financial track record. Some key financial metrics to consider when evaluating dividend stocks include the company's dividend yield, payout ratio, and earnings per share (EPS). The dividend yield is a measure of the annual dividend payment as a percentage of the stock price, while the payout ratio is the percentage of earnings that are paid out as dividends. A high dividend yield and a low payout ratio may indicate that a company has a strong financial position and is able to sustain its dividend payments.In addition to financial metrics, it can be helpful to look at the company's business model and industry trends when evaluating dividend stocks. Companies in stable industries with strong, predictable cash flows are often more likely to pay dividends consistently.It's also important to note that there are no guarantees when it comes to dividend stocks. While some companies have a long history of paying dividends, there is always the risk that a company may reduce or eliminate its dividend payments. This can be due to a variety of factors, including changing market conditions, financial difficulties, or shifts in the company's business strategy.","A dividend stock is a type of stock that pays regular cash dividends to its shareholders. Dividend payments are typically made on a quarterly basis, and the amount of the dividend is generally a fixed amount or a percentage of the company's profits.There are a few key characteristics that investors generally look for when identifying dividend stocks:Strong financials: Companies that pay dividends are generally financially stable, with strong earnings and cash flow. This is important because a company needs to have a consistent stream of profits in order to pay dividends to its shareholders.Dividend yield: This is the amount of the dividend payment expressed as a percentage of the stock's price. A high dividend yield is generally considered more attractive, as it provides a higher return on investment.Dividend growth: Some investors prefer to focus on companies that have a history of consistently increasing their dividends over time. This can be a sign of a company's financial strength and growth potential.Dividend payout ratio: This is the percentage of a company's earnings that are paid out as dividends. A high payout ratio may indicate that a company is paying out a larger portion of its profits as dividends, which could limit its ability to reinvest in the business and potentially impact its growth.Sector: Different sectors tend to have different dividend profiles. For example, utilities and telecom companies are often known for their high dividends, while technology companies are less likely to pay dividends.To identify dividend stocks, investors can use tools like stock screener, which allow you to filter stocks based on different criteria, including dividend yield, payout ratio, and sector.

{"question":"Are there special exceptions to the rule that (US) capital gains taxes are owed only when the gain materializes?","human_answers":["This is really an extended comment on the last paragraph of @BenMiller's answer. When (the manager of) a mutual fund sells securities that the fund holds for a profit, or receives dividends (stock dividends, bond interest, etc.), the fund has the option of paying taxes on that money (at corporate rates) and distributing the rest to shareholders in the fund, or passing on the entire amount (categorized as dividends, qualified dividends, net short-term capital gains, and net long-term capital gains) to the shareholders who then pay taxes on the money that they receive at their own respective tax rates. (If the net gains are negative, i.e. losses, they are not passed on to the shareholders. See the last paragraph below).  A shareholder doesn't have to reinvest the distribution amount into the mutual fund: the option of receiving the money as cash always exists, as does the option of investing the distribution into a different mutual fund in the same family, e.g. invest the distributions from Vanguard's S&P 500 Index Fund into Vanguard's Total Bond Index Fund (and\/or vice versa). This last can be done without needing a brokerage account, but doing it across fund families will require the money to transit through a brokerage account or a personal account. Such cross-transfers can be helpful in reducing the amounts of money being transferred in re-balancing asset allocations as is recommended be done once or twice a year. Those investing in load funds instead of no-load funds should keep in mind that several load funds waive the load for re-investment of distributions but some funds don't: the sales charge for the reinvestment is pure profit for the fund if the fund was purchased directly or passed on to the brokerage if the fund was purchased through a brokerage account. As Ben points out, a shareholder in a mutual fund must pay taxes (in the appropriate categories) on the distributions  from the fund even though no actual cash has been received because the entire distribution has been reinvested. It is worth keeping in mind that when the mutual fund declares a distribution (say $1.22 a share), the Net Asset Value per share drops by the same amount (assuming no change in the prices of the securities that the fund holds) and the new shares issued are at this lower price. That is, there is no change in the value of the investment: if you had $10,000 in the fund the day before the distribution was declared, you still have $10,000 after the distribution is declared but you own more shares in the fund than you had previously. (In actuality, the new shares appear in your account a couple of days later, not immediately when the distribution is declared).  In short, a distribution  from a mutual fund that is re-invested leads to no change in your net assets, but does increase your tax liability. Ditto for a distribution that is taken as cash or re-invested elsewhere. As a final remark, net capital losses inside a mutual fund are not distributed to shareholders but are retained within the fund to be written off against future capital gains. See also this previous answer  or this one."],"chatgpt_answers":["In the United States, capital gains taxes are generally owed when a capital asset, such as a stock or real estate, is sold for a profit. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.One exception is the \"wash sale\" rule, which applies to the sale of securities such as stocks or bonds. Under this rule, if an investor sells a security at a loss and then buys a substantially similar security within 30 days before or after the sale, the loss cannot be claimed on the investor's tax return. This rule is intended to prevent investors from engaging in tax-loss selling, in which they sell a security at a loss in order to claim a tax deduction, and then buy back the same security in order to continue holding it.Another exception is the \"like-kind exchange\" rule, which applies to the exchange of certain types of property, such as real estate. Under this rule, if an investor exchanges one piece of real estate for another without receiving any cash or other property in the process, the exchange is not considered a taxable event.

This can be especially helpful if you are just starting to establish credit or if you have had credit problems in the past.To earn rewards: Many credit cards offer rewards programs that allow you to earn points, miles, or cash back on your purchases. By getting multiple credit cards, you can potentially earn more rewards and maximize your benefits.To take advantage of special offers or promotions: Credit card companies often offer special deals or promotions to attract new customers. By having multiple credit cards, you may be able to take advantage of these offers and save money on things like balance transfers, interest, or fees.To have a backup option: It can be helpful to have more than one credit card in case one is lost, stolen, or compromised. This way, you have a backup option to use until you can get a replacement card.To separate business and personal expenses: If you own a business, you may want to get a separate credit card to use for business expenses. This can help you keep your personal and business finances separate, which can be especially helpful for tax purposes.It's important to keep in mind that having multiple credit cards can also increase your risk of overspending or getting into debt if you don't use them responsibly.

I would expect most repayment plans to be something like make double payments until you are caught up or pay an extra $1000 per month until caught up and then resume normal payments."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several steps you can follow to recalculate a bad loan, also known as a defaulted or delinquent loan. These steps may vary depending on the specific terms of the loan and the circumstances of the borrower, but in general, you can follow the steps outlined below:Review the terms of the loan: Before you begin the process of recalculating a bad loan, it is important to review the terms of the loan and any agreements or contracts that you have signed. This will help you understand the specific requirements and obligations of the loan, as well as any penalties or fees that may apply.Determine the total amount owed: Once you have reviewed the terms of the loan, you should calculate the total amount that is currently owed. This will include any outstanding principal, as well as any interest, fees, or penalties that have accrued.Review the borrower's financial situation: It is important to consider the borrower's financial situation when recalculating a bad loan. This may include reviewing their income, expenses, and any assets they may have. This will help you determine whether the borrower has the ability to make the required payments and if there are any alternative payment options available.Negotiate a repayment plan: Once you have determined the borrower's financial situation and the total amount owed, you can try to negotiate a repayment plan. This may involve extending the loan term, reducing the monthly payment amount, or altering the interest rate. The goal of the repayment plan is to make the loan more manageable for the borrower and help them get back on track with their payments.Follow up and monitor progress: After you have negotiated a repayment plan, it is important to follow up and monitor the borrower's progress. This may involve regular communication with the borrower and tracking their payments to ensure that they are meeting the terms of the repayment plan. If the borrower falls behind on their payments again, you may need to revisit the repayment plan or consider other options, such as debt collection or legal action."]},
{"question":"Dividend vs Growth Stocks for young investors","human_answers":["In financial theory, there is no reason for a difference in investor return to exist between dividend paying and non-dividend paying stocks, except for tax consequences.  This is because in theory, a company can either pay dividends to investors [who can reinvest the funds themselves], or reinvest its capital and earn the same return on that reinvestment [and the shareholder still has the choice to sell a fraction of their holdings, if they prefer to have cash]. That theory may not match reality, because often companies pay or don't pay dividends based on their stage of life.  For example, early-stage mining companies often have no free cashflow to pay dividends [they are capital intensive until the mines are operational]. On the other side, longstanding companies may have no projects left that would be a  good fit for further investment, and so they pay out dividends instead, effectively allowing the shareholder to decide where to reinvest the money. Therefore, saying \"dividend paying\"\/\"growth stock\" can be a proxy for talking about the stage of life + risk and return of a company. Saying dividend paying implies \"long-standing blue chip company with relatively low capital requirements and a stable business\". Likewise \"growth stocks\" [\/ non-dividend paying] implies \"new startup company that still needs capital and thus is somewhat unproven, with a chance for good return to match the higher risk\". So in theory, dividend payment policy makes no difference. In practice, it makes a difference for two reasons: (1) You will most likely be taxed differently on selling stock vs receiving dividends [Which one is better for you is a specific question relying on your jurisdiction, your current income, and things like what type of stock \/ how long you hold it]. For example in Canada, if you earn ~ < $40k, your dividends are very likely to have a preferential tax treatment to selling shares for capital gains [but your province and specific other numbers would influence this]. In the United States, I believe capital gains are usually preferential as long as you hold the shares for a long time [but I am not 100% on this without looking it up]. (2) Dividend policy implies differences in the stage of life \/ risk level of a stock. This implication is not guaranteed, so be sure you are using other considerations to determine whether this is the case.  Therefore which dividend policy suits you better depends on your tax position and your risk tolerance."],"chatgpt_answers":["Dividend stocks are stocks that pay out a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends, while growth stocks are stocks in companies that are expected to experience rapid growth in the future. Both types of stocks can be good options for young investors, depending on their investment goals and risk tolerance.Here are a few things to consider when deciding between dividend and growth stocks:Investment goals: If you're looking for income, dividend stocks can be a good choice. These stocks provide a regular stream of cash payments that can be used to supplement your income or reinvested to generate more returns. Growth stocks, on the other hand, may not pay dividends at all or may pay very small dividends. Instead, these stocks offer the potential for capital appreciation as the company grows and its stock price increases.Risk tolerance: Dividend stocks tend to be less risky than growth stocks because they offer a steady stream of income that can help to cushion the impact of market fluctuations. Growth stocks, on the other hand, tend to be more volatile and carry more risk. The potential for high returns is there, but so is the potential for significant losses.Time horizon: If you have a long-term investment horizon, growth stocks may be a good choice. These stocks offer the potential for significant capital appreciation over time, as the company grows and its stock price increases. Dividend stocks may also be a good option for long-term investors, as the dividends can provide a steady stream of income while the stock price appreciates. However, if you have a shorter time horizon, dividend stocks may be a better choice as they offer a more predictable stream of income.Ultimately, the best choice for you will depend on your individual financial situation and investment goals. It's important to do your own research and carefully consider your options before making a decision."]},

A very few people are much better off with insurance.  Insurance is a gamble and when you lose, you win.  Very few people lose badly enough to win.  Most people just pay money into insurance and never get as much back as they pay in.  For most people, in most lives, insurance is a bad deal.  The reason people crave insurance is because they cannot calculate the probability of something bad happening as well as an actuary can do so.  The gap in knowledge between you and and actuary is what make insurance providers rich and you poor.  They are smart, you are not.

Anyhow, most people can't understand probability, and how to analyze risk, so they won't get what I'm saying here. Understanding the real cost of risk is the first lesson in understanding money and wealth.  Rich people usually understand the value and cost of risk.

I offer this anecdote to share a 'deduction' story - The first year I did my MIL's taxes, I had to explain that she didn't   have enough deductions to itemize. Every year since, she hands me a   file full of paper substantiating medical deductions that don't exceed   7.5% of her income. In turn, I give her two folders back, one with the 5 or so documents I needed, and the rest labeled \"trash\". Fewer than 30% of filers itemize. And a good portion of those that do, have no question that's the right thing to do. e.g. my property tax is more than the $12K, so anything else I have that's a deduction adds right to the number.  It's really just those people who are at the edge that are likely frustrated. I wrote an article regarding Standard Deduction vs Itemizing, in which I describe a method of pulling in one's deductible expenses into Odd years, reducing the number in Even years, to allow a bi-annual itemization. If this is your situation, you'll find the concept interesting.  You also ask about filing status. Think on this for a minute. After pulling in our W2s (TurboTax imports the data right from ADP), I do the same for our stock info. The stock info, and all Schedule A deductions aren't assigned a name. So any effort to split them in search of savings by using Married Filing Separate, would first require splitting these up. TurboTax has a 'what-if' worksheet for this function, but when the 'marriage penalty' was lifted years ago, the change in status had no value. Items that phaseout over certain income levels are often lost to the separate filer anyway. When I got married, I found my real estate losses each year could not be taken, they accumulated until I either sold, or until our income dropped when the Mrs retired.

When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power of money. A chief measure of price inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index (normally the consumer price index) over time.Inflation can be caused by various factors, such as an increase in the supply of money, an increase in government spending, or a decrease in taxes. When the supply of money increases faster than the supply of goods and services, prices tend to rise, resulting in inflation. On the other hand, when the supply of goods and services increases faster than the supply of money, prices tend to fall, resulting in deflation.Inflation is generally measured using a price index, such as the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the average price of a basket of goods and services consumed by households. The rate of inflation is calculated by comparing the price index in one period to the price index in a previous period and expressing the difference as a percentage. For example, if the CPI was 100 in January and rose to 105 in February, the rate of inflation over that one-month period would be 5%."]},

A company operating in a large and growing market may have greater potential for growth and profitability compared to a company operating in a smaller or declining market.Market share: The market share held by a company can also be an important factor to consider. A company with a large market share may have a competitive advantage over its rivals and be better positioned to generate strong sales and revenue.Financial performance: It's important to examine a company's financial performance, including its sales and revenue growth, profitability, and financial stability. A company with strong financial performance may be a better investment opportunity compared to a company with weaker financials.Valuation: The valuation of a company, as reflected in its stock price or other financial metrics, can also be an important factor to consider when comparing investment opportunities. A company with a high valuation may be considered overvalued and therefore less attractive as an investment compared to a company with a lower valuation.It's also worth considering other factors such as the management team, competitive landscape, and industry trends when comparing investment opportunities.

{"question":"Expecting to move in five years; how to lock mortgage rates?","human_answers":["You could consider turning your current place into a Rental Property. This is more easily done with a fixed rate loan, and you said you have an ARM. The way it would work: If you can charge enough rent to cover your current mortgage plus the interest-difference on your new mortgage, then the income from your rental property can effectively lower the interest rate on your new home.   By keeping your current low rate, month-after-month, you'll pay the market rate on your new home, but you'll also receive rental income from your previous home to offset the increased cost.

{"question":"How does a TFSA work? Where does the interest come from?","human_answers":["As to where the interest comes from: The same place it comes from in other kinds of savings accounts. The bank takes the money you deposit and invests it elsewhere, traditionally by lending it out to others (hence the concept of a \"savings and loan\" bank). They make a profit as long as the interest they give for \"borrowing\" from you, plus the cost of administering the savings accounts and loans, is less than the interest they charge for lending to others. No, they don't have to pay you interest -- but if they didn't, you'd be likely to deposit your funds at another bank which did. Their ideal goal is to pay as little as possible without losing depositors, while charging as much as possible without losing borrowers. (yeah, I know, typo corrected) Why do they get higher interest rate than they pay you? Mostly because your deposits and interest are essentially guaranteed, whereas the folks they're lending to may be late paying or default on those loans. As with any kind of investment, higher return requires more work and\/or higher risk, plus (ususally) larger reserves so you can afford to ride out any losses that do occur."],"chatgpt_answers":["A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a type of savings account available in Canada that allows you to earn investment income tax-free.

When you deposit money into a TFSA, you can choose to invest that money in a variety of products, such as savings accounts, term deposits, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and stocks. The return on these investments is what generates the interest you earn on your TFSA.There are limits on how much you can contribute to a TFSA each year, and any unused contribution room carries forward to future years.

{"question":"Where can I buy stocks if I only want to invest a little bit at a time, and not really be involved in trading?","human_answers":["There's a few options you may want to look into. First, I'm writing from an US point of view, I do not know if these are available in Russia.  First look into DRIPS (Dividend Reinvestment Plans). These seem tailor made for your request. They are plans set up by companies that pay dividends. If you own at least one share (costing no more than say $100 often less), then these companies will take the dividends paid on these shares and automatically buy more shares as the income from the dividends pile up. This is a low cost of entry way of getting in on many high quality stocks. Stalwart stocks such as GE and many utility and real estate stocks (REITs) offer this.  Check out these links: Secondly you can look at brokerages that specialize in buying smaller amount of stocks on a regular basis to simulate a DRIP, ShareBuilder will allow you to invest say $50 or $100 a month into one or more stocks. However, at smaller amounts, their commission fees can eat in to your returns.  Folio investing does the same thing as Sharebuilder. It's worth looking at them both and comparing their commissions and other features"],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several options for buying stocks if you only want to invest a little bit at a time and not be involved in trading. One option is to open an account with a brokerage firm that offers fractional shares. Fractional shares allow you to buy a portion of a stock rather than having to buy an entire share. This can be a good option if you only have a small amount of money to invest and don't want to wait until you have enough to buy a whole share.Another option is to invest in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). These types of investment vehicles allow you to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks or other assets with a single purchase. You can choose a mutual fund or ETF that is focused on a particular market sector or invest in a broad-based fund that holds a wide range of stocks.You can also consider using a robo-advisor, which is an online investment platform that uses algorithms to build and manage your investment portfolio. Many robo-advisors allow you to set up a regular investment plan, where you can automatically invest a set amount of money at regular intervals.Finally, you can consider using a microinvesting app, which allows you to invest small amounts of money in a variety of stocks or other assets. These apps often have a low minimum investment requirement and allow you to set up a regular investment plan.Regardless of which option you choose, it's important to do your research and carefully consider your investment goals and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions."]},

If the market is experiencing a downturn or if there is negative news about the company, the stock price may not be high enough to make selling worthwhile.Holding period requirements: Some investors may be required to hold a stock for a certain period of time before they are eligible to receive the dividend. For example, a company may specify that investors must hold the stock for at least 60 days before the ex-dividend date in order to receive the dividend.Taxes: Capital gains taxes may be incurred when selling stocks, and these taxes can eat into the profits made from selling the stock. If the profit from selling the stock is not high enough to offset the taxes, it may not be worth it for the investor to sell.Diversification: Many investors aim to diversify their portfolio by holding a variety of different stocks. This may prevent them from selling high yield stocks as soon as their dividends are paid out, as they may want to hold onto the stock for the long term in order to maintain a diverse portfolio.Investment goals: Some investors may have long-term investment goals that involve holding onto stocks for an extended period of time in order to benefit from potential price appreciation or to receive ongoing dividends.

{"question":"What if 40% of the remaining 60% Loan To Value (ratio) is not paid, or the borrower wants to take only 60% of the loan?","human_answers":["This is the meat of your potato question. The rephrasing of the question to a lending\/real estate executive such as myself, I'd ask, what's the scenario? \"I would say you're looking for an Owner Occupied, Super Jumbo Loan with 20% Down or $360K down on the purchase price, $1.8 mil purchase price, Loan Amount is ~$1.45 mil.

As long as it's less than 35%, you're okay.  Can someone do this loan, the short answer is yes. It's smart that you want to keep more cash on hand. Which is understandable, if the price of the property declines, you've lost your shirt and your down payment, then it will take close to 10 years to recover your down. Consider that you are buying at a peak in real estate prices. Prices can't go up more than they are now. Consider that properties peaked in 2006, cooled in 2007, and crashed in 2008. Properties declined for more than 25-45% in 2008; regardless of your reasons of not wanting to come to the full 40% down, it's a bit smarter to hold on to cash for other investments purposes. Just incase a recession does hit.  In the end, if you do the deal-You'll pay more in points, a higher rate compared to the 40% down scenario, the origination fee would increase slightly but you'll keep your money on hand to invest elsewhere, perhaps some units that can help with the cashflow of your home.

If your debt is low or zero, and income is as high as the scenario, with a fico score of at least 680, you can do the deal all day long. These deals are not uncommon in today's market. Rate will vary.

{"question":"Can a put option and call option be exercised for the same stock with different strike prices?","human_answers":["You could have both options exercised (and assigned to you) on the same day, but I don't think you could lose money on both on the same day. The reason is that while exercises are immediate, assignments are processed after the markets close at the end of each day. See http:\/\/www.888options.com\/help\/faq\/assignment.jsp for details. So you would get both assignments at the same time, that night. The net effect should be that you don't own any stock (someone would put you the stock, then it'd be called away) and you don't have the options anymore. You should have incoming cash of $1500 selling the stock to the call exerciser and outgoing cash of $1300 buying from the put exerciser, right? So you would have no more options but $200 more cash in your account in the morning. You bought at 13 and sold at 15. This options position is an agreement to buy at 13 and sell at 15 at someone else's option. The way you lose money is if one of the options isn't exercised while the other is, i.e. if the stock is below 13 so nobody is going to opt to buy from you at 15, but they'll sell to you at 13; or above 15 so nobody is going to opt to sell to you at 13, but they'll buy from you at 15. You make money if neither is exercised (you keep the premium you sold for) or both are exercised (you keep the gap between the two, plus the premium). Having both exercised is surely rare, since early exercise is rare to begin with, and tends to happen when options are deep in the money; so you'd expect both to be exercised if both are deep in the money at some point. Having both be exercised on the same day ... can't be common, but it's maybe most likely just before expiration with minimal time value, if the stock moves around quickly so both options are in the money at some point during the day."],"chatgpt_answers":["Yes, a put option and a call option can be exercised for the same stock with different strike prices.

If the stock is currently trading at $55 per share, you could exercise your call option to buy the stock at $50 per share, and then sell it in the market for $55 per share, resulting in a profit of $5 per share.

{"question":"Is this mortgage advice good, or is it hooey?","human_answers":["I think the idea here is that because of the way mortgages are amortized, you can drop additional principal payments in the early years of the mortgage and significantly lower the overall interest expense over the life of the loan. A HELOC accrues interest like a credit card, so if you make a large principal payment using a HELOC, you will be able to retire those \"chunks\" of debt quicker than if you made normal mortgage payments. I haven't worked out the numbers, but I suspect that you could achieve similar results by simply paying ahead -- making even one extra payment per year will take 7-9 years off of a 30 year loan. I think that the advantage of the HELOC approach is that if you borrow enough, you may be able to recalculate\/lower the payment of the mortgage."],"chatgpt_answers":["I'm sorry, but I'm not able to provide specific mortgage advice as I am an artificial intelligence trained to assist with general knowledge and information.

This means that if the value of the property increases over the course of the loan, the borrower will pay a higher amount back to the lender when the loan is repaid, based on the agreed-upon percentage of appreciation. If the value of the property decreases, the borrower will pay back a lower amount.An equity loan, on the other hand, is a type of loan in which the borrower uses the equity in their property as collateral. The equity in a property is the difference between the property's value and the amount of debt secured by the property, such as a mortgage. For example, if a property is worth $500,000 and the borrower has a mortgage of $300,000, the equity in the property is $200,000. If the borrower takes out an equity loan, they can borrow money using the equity in their property as collateral.

{"question":"Does investing money in other currencies help pad losses in case of a stock market crash?","human_answers":["If the equity market in the USA crashed, its very likely equity markets everywhere else would crash. The USA has a high number of the world's largest businesses and there are correlations between equity markets. So you need to think of equities as a global asset class, not regional. Your question is then a question about the correlation between equity markets and currency markets.  Here's a guess: If equity markets crashed, you would see a lot of panic selling of stocks denominated in many currencies, but probably the most in USD, due to the large number of the world's largest businesses trading on US stock exchanges. Therefore, when the rest of the world sells US equities they receive cash USD, which they might sell for their local currency. That selling pressure would cause USD to fall. But, when equity markets crash there's a move to safety of the bond markets. The world's largest bond markets are denominated in which currency? Probably USD. So those who receive USD for their equities are going to spend that USD on bonds. In which case there is probably no correlation between equity markets and currency markets at all.

{"question":"Pros, cons, and taxation of Per Diem compensation?","human_answers":["Beware if injured on the job they will not add per diem to your wages meaning you make less and your wc benefits will be less !!"],"chatgpt_answers":["Per diem compensation is a type of payment that is given to employees to cover expenses related to their work, such as meals, lodging, and transportation. Here are some potential pros and cons of using per diem compensation:Pros:Per diem payments can be an efficient way to compensate employees for expenses related to their work, as they do not require itemized receipts or other documentation.Per diem payments can be easier for employees to budget and manage, as they know exactly how much they will be receiving upfront.For employers, per diem payments can be a more cost-effective way to compensate employees for business expenses, as they do not have to track and reimburse individual expenses.Cons:Per diem payments may not fully cover all of an employee's expenses, particularly if they are in a location with higher costs of living.Per diem payments are generally taxable, so employees will need to pay taxes on the amount they receive.Some employees may prefer to have their expenses reimbursed directly, rather than receiving a per diem payment.In terms of taxation, per diem payments are generally taxable as income. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, such as if the employee is required to work away from home overnight and their employer does not provide them with lodging. In this case, the per diem payment may be tax-free up to the maximum federal per diem rate for the location.

{"question":"Can the Philadelphia Center City District Tax be deducted on my Schedule-A?","human_answers":["My basic rule of thumb is that if the the bill come from a government office of taxation, and that if you fail to pay the amount they can put a tax lien on the property it is a tax. for you the complication is in Pub530: Assessments for local benefits.    You cannot deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to increase the value of your property.   Local benefits include the construction of streets, sidewalks, or   water and sewer systems. You must add these amounts to the basis of   your property.  You can, however, deduct assessments (or taxes) for   local benefits if they are for maintenance, repair, or interest   charges related to those benefits. An example is a charge to repair an   existing sidewalk and any interest included in that charge.  If only a   part of the assessment is for maintenance, repair, or interest   charges, you must be able to show the amount of that part to claim the   deduction. If you cannot show what part of the assessment is for   maintenance, repair, or interest charges, you cannot deduct any of it. An assessment for a local benefit may be listed as an item in your   real estate tax bill. If so, use the rules in this section to find how   much of it, if any, you can deduct. I have never seen a tax bill that said this amount is for new streets, and the rest i for things the IRS says you can deduct. The issue is that if the Center City tax bill is a separate line or a separate bill then does it count. I would go back to the first line of the quote from Pub 530: You cannot deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to   increase the value of your property. Then I would look at the quote from the CCD web site: The Center City District (CCD) is a business improvement district. Our   mission is to keep Philadelphia's downtown, called Center City, clean,   safe, beautiful and fun. We provide security, cleaning and promotional   services that supplement, but do not replace, basic services provided   by the City of Philadelphia and the fundamental responsibilities of   property owners. CCD also makes physical improvements to the downtown, installing and maintaining lighting, > signs, banners, trees and landscape elements.  and later on the same page: CCD directly bills and collects mandatory payments from properties in   the district. CCD also receives voluntary contributions from the   owners of tax-exempt properties that benefit from our services. The issues is that it is a business improvement district (BID), and you aren't a business: I did find this document from the city of Philadelphia explain how to establish a BID: If the nature of the BID is such that organizers wish to include   residential properties within the district and make these properties   subject to the assessment, it may make sense to assess these   properties at a lower level than a commercial property, both because   BID services and benefits are business-focused, and because   owner-occupants often cannot treat NID assessments as tax-deductible   business expenses, like commercial owners do. Care must be taken to   ensure that the difference in commercial and residential assessment   rates is equitable, and complies with the requirements of the CEIA. from the same document: Funds for BID programs and services are generated from a special   assessment paid by the benefited property owners directly to the   organization that manages the BID\u2019s activities. (Note: many leases   have a clause that allows property owners to pass the BID assessment   on to their tenants.) Because they are authorized by the City of   Philadelphia, the assessment levied by the BID becomes a legal   obligation of the property owner and failure to pay can result in the   filing of a lien. I have seen discussion that some BIDS can accept tax deductible donations. This means if a person itemizes they can deduct the donation. I would then feel comfortable deducting the tax because: If you can't deduct it that would mean the only people who can't deduct it are home owners.  So deduct it.

For example, if you have credit card debt with an interest rate of 20%, paying off that debt should be a priority because you are likely to pay more in interest over time than you would earn from saving or investing the money.On the other hand, if you have low-interest debt or no debt at all, it may be a good idea to focus on saving and investing for the long term.

{"question":"How to calculate average drawdown of a trading system?","human_answers":["First of all, I think I'll clear off some confusion in the topic. The Sterling Ratio is a very simple investment portfolio measurement that fits nicely to the topic of personal finance, although not so much to a foreign exchange trading system. The Sterling Ratio is mainly used in the context of hedge funds to measure its risk-reward ratio for long term investments. To do so, it has been adapted to the following in order to appear more like the Sharpe Ratio:  I Suppose this is why you question the Average Largest Draw-down. I'll come back to that later. It's original definition, suggested by the company Deane Sterling Jones, is a little different and perhaps the one you should use if you want to measure your trading system's long term risk-reward ratio, which is as followed:  Note: Average Annual Draw-down has to be negative on the above-mentioned formula. This one is very simple to calculate and the one to use if you want to measure any portfolio's long-term results, such an example of a 5 or 10 years period and calculate the average of each years largest drawdown. To answer @Dheer's comment, this specific measurement can also be used in personal investments portfolio, which is considered a topic related to personal finance. Back to the first one, which answers your question. It's used in most cases in investment strategies, such as hedging, not trading systems. By hedging I mean that in these cases long term investments are made in anti-correlated securities to obtain a diversified portfolio with a very stable growth. This one is calculated normally annually because you rely on the Annual Risk-Free Rate. Having that in mind I think you can guess that the Average Largest Drawdown is the average between the Largest\/Maximum Drawdown from each security in the portfolio. And this doesn't make sense in a trading system. Example: If you have invested in 5 different securities where we calculated the Largest Draw-down for each, such as represented in the following array: MaxDD[5] = { 0.12, 0.23, 0.06, 0.36, 0.09 }, in this case your Average Largest Draw-down is the average(MaxDD) that equals 0.172 or 17,2% If your portfolio's annual return is 15% and the Risk-free Rate is 10%, your Sterling Ratio SR = (0.15 - 0.10)\/0.172, which result to 0.29. The higher the rate better is the risk-reward ratio of your portfolio. I suggest in your case to only use the original Sterling Ratio to calculate your long-term risk-reward, in any other case I suggest looking at the Sharpe and Sortino ratios instead."],"chatgpt_answers":["To calculate the average drawdown of a trading system, you will need to follow these steps:Identify the starting and ending points of each drawdown period in your trading system.

{"question":"Is the Net Profit the 'final word' on a company's health? ","human_answers":["To answer your question briefly: net income is affected by many things inside and outside of management control, and must be supplemented by other elements to gain a clear picture of a company's health. To answer your question in-depth, we must look at the history of financial reporting: Initially, accounting was primarily cash-based. That is, a business records a sale when a customer pays them cash, and records expenses when cash goes out the door. This was not a perfectly accurate system, as cashflow might be quite erratic even if sales are stable (collection times may differ, etc.). To combat problems with cash-based accounting, financial reporting moved to an accrual-based system. An accrual is the recording of an item before it has fully completed in a cash transaction. For example, when you ship goods to a customer and they owe you money, you record the revenue - then you record the future collection of cash as a balance sheet item, rather than an income statement item. Another example: if your landlord charges you rent on December 31st for the past year, then in each month leading up to December, you accrue the expense on the income statement, even though you haven't paid the landlord yet. Accrual-based accounting leaves room for accounting manipulation. Enron is a prime example; among other things, they were accruing revenue for sales that had not occurred. This 'accelerated' their income, by having it recorded years before cash was ever collectible. There are specific guidelines that restrict doing things like this, but management will still attempt to accelerate net income as much as possible under accounting guidelines. Public companies have their financial statements audited by unrelated accounting firms - theoretically, they exist to catch material misstatements in the financial statements. Finally, some items impacting profit do not show up in net income - they show up in \"Other Comprehensive Income\" (OCI). OCI is meant to show items that occurred in the year, but were outside of management control. For example, changes in the value of foreign subsidiaries, due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Or changes in the value of company pension plan, which are impacted by the stock market. However, while OCI is meant to pick up all non-management-caused items, it is a grey area and may not be 100% representative of this idea. So in theory, net income is meant to represent items within management control. However, given the grey area in accounting interpretation, net income may be 'accelerated', and it also may include some items that occurred by some 'random business fluke' outside of company control. Finally, consider that financial statements are prepared months after the last year-end. So a company may show great profit for 2015 when statements come out in March, but perhaps Jan-March results are terrible. In conclusion, net income is an attempt at giving what you want: an accurate representation of the health of a company in terms of what is under management control. However it may be inaccurate due to various factors, from malfeasance to incompetence.  That's why other financial measures exist - as another way to answer the same question about a company's health, to see if those answers agree. ex: Say net income is $10M this year, but was only $6M last year - great, it went up by $4M! But now assume that Accounts Receivable shows $7M owed to the company at Dec 31, when last year there was only $1M owed to the company. That might imply that there are problems collecting on that additional revenue (perhaps revenue was recorded prematurely, or perhaps they sold to customers who went bankrupt).  Unfortunately there is no single number that you can use to see the whole company - different metrics must be used in conjunction to get a clear picture."],"chatgpt_answers":["Net profit is an important measure of a company's financial performance, but it is not the only factor to consider when evaluating the health of a company. Here are some other factors to consider:Revenue: This is the total amount of money a company brings in from sales of its products or services. A company with strong revenue growth is generally considered to be in good health.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA): This measures a company's profitability before taking into account certain expenses such as interest payments, taxes, and non-cash charges. EBITDA can be a useful measure of a company's financial health because it excludes certain expenses that may not be relevant to all companies.Cash flow: This measures the amount of cash a company generates from its operations. A company with strong cash flow is better able to pay its bills, invest in new projects, and return money to shareholders.Return on investment (ROI): This measures the profitability of a company based on the amount of money invested in it. A high ROI indicates that a company is using its resources effectively to generate profits.Debt: A company's debt level can affect its financial health. If a company has a high level of debt, it may be at risk of defaulting on its loan payments. On the other hand, a company with very little debt may have more flexibility to make investments and take on new projects.In summary, net profit is an important measure of a company's financial health, but it is just one factor to consider. It's important to look at a company's financial performance from multiple angles in order to get a complete picture of its health."]},

If you held the stock for more than one year before selling it, the gain or loss from the sale is considered to be long-term. If you held the stock for one year or less, the gain or loss is considered to be short-term.Calculate the gain or loss from the sale: To calculate the gain or loss, subtract the purchase price of the stock (including any commissions or fees) from the sale price of the stock. If the result is positive, you have a gain. If the result is negative, you have a loss.Determine the tax rate on the gain or loss: The tax rate on the gain or loss from the sale of a stock depends on the holding period and your tax bracket. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term capital gains.Calculate the interest portion of the income: The interest portion of the income is the portion of the gain or loss that is taxed at the tax rate for interest income. If the gain or loss is long-term, the entire amount is taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate. If the gain or loss is short-term, the entire amount is taxed at the short-term capital gains tax rate, which is the same as the tax rate for ordinary income.For example, let's say that you bought 100 shares of a stock for $50 per share, including commissions, and you sold the stock for $75 per share, including commissions. Your total gain on the sale would be $2,500 ($75 per share x 100 shares - $50 per share x 100 shares). If you held the stock for more than one year, your gain would be taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate.

It looks like you already know how to do this.  Here the trading accounts will help you, especially if you have Finance:Quote set up (to pull security prices from the internet). For the actively-managed accounts, you can just create each managed account and NOT fill it with the separate securities.  You can record the changes in that account in summary each month\/year as you prefer. So, you might set up your chart of accounts to include these assets: And this income: The actively-managed accounts will each get set up as Type \"Stock.\"  You will create one fake security for each account, which will get your unrealized gains\/losses on active accounts showing up in your trading accounts.  The fake securities will NOT be pulling prices from the internet.  Go to     Tools -> Securities Editor -> Add and type in a name such as \"Merrill Lynch Brokerage,\" a symbol such as \"ML1,\" and in the \"Type\" field input something like \"Actively Managed.\" In your self-managed accounts, you will record dividends and sales as they occur, and your securities will be set to get quotes online.  You can follow the general GnuCash guides for this.   In your too-many-transactions actively traded accounts, maybe once a month you will gather up your statements and enter the activity in summary to tie the changes in cost basis.  I would suggest making each fake \"share\" equal $1, so if you have a $505 dividend, you buy 505 \"shares\" with it.  So, you might have these transactions for your brokerage account with Merrill Lynch (for example): When you have finished making your period-end summary entries for all the actively-managed accounts, double-check that the share balances of your actively-managed accounts match the cost basis amounts on your statements.  Remember that each fake \"share\" is worth $1 when you enter it.  Once the cost basis is tied, you can go into the price editor (Tools -> Price Editor) and enter a new \"price\" as of the period-end date for each actively-managed account.  The price will be \"Value of Active Acct at Period-End\/Cost of Active Acct at Period-End.\"  So, if your account was worth $1908 but had a cost basis of $505 on Jan. 31, you would type \"1908\/505\" in the price field and Jan. 31, 2017 in the date field. When you run your reports, you will want to choose the price source as \"Nearest in Time\" so that GnuCash grabs the correct quotes.

{"question":"Taxes, Puts and the Wash Rule","human_answers":["There are different schools of thought. You can ask the IRS - and it would not surprise me if you got different answers on different phone calls. One interpretation is that a put is not \"substantially identical\" to the disposed stock, therefore no wash is triggered by that sale. However if that put is exercised, then you automatically purchase the security, and that is identical. As to whether the IRS (or your brokerage firm) recognizes the identical security when it falls out of an option, I can't say; but technically they could enforce it because the rule is based on 30 days and a \"substantially identical\" stock or security. In this interpretation (your investor) would probably at least want to stay out of the money in choosing a strike price, to avoid exercise; however, options are normally either held or sold, rather than be exercised, until at or very close to the expiration date (because time value is left on the table otherwise). So the key driver in this interpretation would be expiration date, which should be at least 31 days out from the stock sale; and it would be prudent to sell an out of the money put as well, in order to avoid the wash sale trigger. However there is also a more unfavorable opinion - see fairmark.com\/capgain\/wash\/wsoption.htm where they hold that a \"deep in the money\" option is an immediate trigger (regardless of exercise). This article is sage, in that they say that the Treasury (IRS) may interpret an option transaction as a wash if it's ballpark to being exercisable. And, if the IRS throws paper, it always beats each of paper, rock and scissors :( A Schwab article (\"A Primer on Wash Sales\") says, if the CUSIPs match, bang, wash. This is the one that they may interpret unfavorably on in any case, supporting Schwab's \"play it safe\" position: \"3. Acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities...\" . This certainly nails buying a call. As to selling a put, well, it is at least conceivable that an IRS official would call that a contract to buy! SO it's simply not a slam dunk; there are varying opinions that you might describe as ranging from \"hell no\" to \"only if blatant.\" If you can get an \"official\" predetermination, or you like to go aggressive in your tax strategy, there's that; they may act adversely, so Caveat Taxfiler!"],"chatgpt_answers":["The wash rule is a tax rule that applies to the sale of securities.

The instructions confirm that this should be the amount that you received listed on the 1099-MISC. Report on line 4 royalties from oil, gas, or mineral properties (not including operating interests); copyrights; and patents. Use a separate column (A, B, or C) for each royalty property.

Report this amount on line 4.  I don't think that there's any relevant Expenses deductions you could take on the subsequent lines (though like I said, I've not used this form before), but if you had some specific expenses involved in producing this income it might be worth looking into further. On Line 21 you'd subtract the 0 expenses (or subtract any expenses you do manage to list) and put the total. It looks like there are more totals to accumulate on lines 23 and 24, which presumably would be equally easy as you only have the one property.

{"question":"Canada: New mortgage qualification rules, 2010: Why, what, & when in effect?","human_answers":["The new mortgage qualification rules were introduced to cool a hot Canadian housing real estate market. The rules are a pre-emptive measure intended to avoid a bubble (and later crash) in real estate. The government wants to make sure anybody buying a house can handle higher interest rates. Those rates, currently at record lows, are expected to go up later this year and into the future. The tighter mortgage rules include: Borrowers will need to qualify against a minimum standard 5-year fixed rate mortgage, even if they'll contract their mortgage at a lower or variable rate.  Previously, the 3-year fixed rate mortgage was used as the minimum qualification standard. The amount a homeowner can borrow in a refinanced mortgage drops to 90% of the home value, down from 95% of the home value.  A home is not meant to be an ATM machine. Anybody wanting to borrow to buy an investment property \u2013 i.e. a property that won't be their principal residence \u2013 will need a 20% downpayment instead of a 5% downpayment.

However, according to the backgrounder (see below): Exceptions would be allowed after   April 19 where they are needed to   satisfy a binding purchase and sale,   financing, or refinancing agreement   entered into before April 19, 2010. Definitive information about the new rules can be found at the Department of Finance of Canada.  Specifically, refer to: Some additional news media sources:"],"chatgpt_answers":["In 2010, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) in Canada introduced new mortgage qualification rules, known as the \"stress test,\" in order to ensure that borrowers could still make their mortgage payments if interest rates were to rise or their personal circumstances changed. These rules went into effect on October 17, 2016.The stress test requires borrowers to qualify for a mortgage at a higher interest rate than the rate they are actually being offered by their lender. For example, if a borrower is being offered a mortgage at a rate of 3%, they must qualify for the mortgage at a rate of at least the Bank of Canada's five-year benchmark rate, which is currently 5.24%, or at the lender's contract rate plus an additional 2%, whichever is higher. This helps to ensure that borrowers can still afford their mortgage payments if interest rates were to rise in the future.The stress test applies to all insured mortgages, which are mortgages with a down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price. It also applies to uninsured mortgages for borrowers who have a credit score of 680 or higher and who meet certain other criteria.The main reason for introducing the stress test was to help reduce the risk of default on mortgages and to protect the stability of the housing market in Canada. The stress test has been controversial, with some arguing that it has made it more difficult for first-time homebuyers to enter the housing market, while others argue that it has helped to prevent a housing bubble and to protect the financial stability of the country."]},

This election is typically made in the case of restricted stock, which is stock that is subject to vesting and is not immediately transferable.Making an 83(b) election can be beneficial in certain circumstances, as it allows the taxpayer to pay tax on the value of the restricted stock at the time it is received, rather than waiting until it vests and potentially paying a higher tax rate on a larger amount of income. However, this election also carries some risk, as the taxpayer is required to pay tax on the value of the restricted stock at the time it is received, even if the value decreases in the future.Long-term capital gains are profits from the sale of assets held for more than one year. In the US, long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, although the exact rate depends on the taxpayer's income level.It's worth noting that making an 83(b) election does not affect the tax treatment of any gain or loss on the sale of the stock.

They may be influenced by factors such as the opening and closing bell, news announcements, and trading volume.Weekly cycles: These patterns occur over the course of a week and may be influenced by factors such as the beginning and end of the work week, monthly earnings reports, and economic data releases.Monthly cycles: These patterns occur over the course of a month and may be influenced by factors such as the end of the month, quarterly earnings reports, and economic data releases.Seasonal cycles: These patterns occur at the same time each year and may be influenced by factors such as the holiday season, weather patterns, and industry-specific trends.It's important to note that while periodicity can be a useful tool for analyzing stock charts, it is not a reliable indicator of future price movements. It is always important to consider a variety of factors, including fundamental analysis and economic conditions, when making investment decisions."]},
{"question":"How to estimate federal and state taxes likely to be due on my side income?","human_answers":["Most states that have income tax base their taxes on the income reported on your federal return, with some state-specific adjustments.

For estimating the tax liability, I would not use the effective rate but rather use the rate for your highest tax bracket and apply that to your estimated hobby income, assuming that you primary job income won't be wildly higher or lower than last year. As @keshlam noted in a comment, this income is coming on top of whatever else you earn, so it will be taxed at your top rate. Finally, I'd check again whether this is really \"hobby\" income or if it is \"self-employment\" income.  Self-employment income will be subject to self-employment tax, which comes on top of the regular income tax."],"chatgpt_answers":["To estimate your federal and state taxes likely to be due on your side income, you'll need to consider several factors, including:Your filing status: This will determine the tax brackets you'll be subject to and the tax rates that will apply to your income.Your total income: This includes not only your side income but also any other income you earn, such as from a full-time job or investments.Any deductions or credits you're eligible for: These can reduce the amount of tax you owe by lowering your taxable income.Your state's tax laws: Some states have their own income tax, while others do not. You'll need to check the tax laws in your state to determine what you'll owe.To get a rough estimate of your federal and state taxes, you can use a tax calculator or tax software.

{"question":"How decreasing the prime interest rate helps to offset decreasing oil prices ","human_answers":["You may be missing how countries like Canada may have oil be more of the GDP than countries like the US.

In contrast, the US isn't quite as rich in Energy sources and thus may not have the same issues would be my guess. Context matters here. If the rate change helps everybody, doesn't that include the oil producing companies? I'd like to think so using basic logic. What if the main reason for lowering rates was the economic fallout of the decrease in oil prices? Consider that the there would be the question of, \"Why do this now?\" that has to be answered and the only main change is lower oil prices on a macroeconomic level."],"chatgpt_answers":["Decreasing the prime interest rate can help to offset the negative effects of decreasing oil prices in a number of ways.First, a lower prime interest rate can stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and individuals. This can encourage increased spending and investment, which can help to boost economic growth and offset the negative impact of declining oil prices.Second, a lower interest rate can also help to improve the competitiveness of non-oil exporting countries, as it makes their exports cheaper for foreigners to purchase. This can help to offset the negative impact of declining oil prices on these countries' trade balances.Finally, a lower interest rate can help to stabilize financial markets and reduce the risk of financial instability. This can help to mitigate the negative impact of declining oil prices on the overall economy.It's important to note, however, that while decreasing the prime interest rate can help to offset the negative effects of declining oil prices, it is not a panacea and may not be sufficient on its own to fully offset these effects. Other policy measures, such as fiscal policy or structural reforms, may also be needed to address the negative impact of declining oil prices on the economy."]},

Some potential causes include:News or events: A significant announcement or event, such as earnings results, an acquisition, or a regulatory change, can cause a stock to fluctuate in the after-hours market.Limited liquidity: The after-hours market tends to have lower liquidity compared to the regular market, which means there may be fewer buyers and sellers. This can lead to price swings due to supply and demand imbalances.Technical issues: Trading errors or technical issues with exchanges or other market infrastructure can also cause price abnormalities in the after-hours market.Market manipulation: In some cases, extreme price movements in the after-hours market may be the result of market manipulation, where traders attempt to artificially influence the price of a stock for their own benefit.It's important to note that the after-hours market can be more volatile and less efficient compared to the regular market, so it's important for investors to be aware of these risks when trading in the after-hours market."]},

At that time, the yen was divided into 100 sen, which made it easier to conduct transactions and facilitated trade with other countries. The division of the yen into smaller units has remained in place since then and is now an integral part of Japan's monetary system.It is worth noting that many countries have gone through similar processes of currency division in the past, including the United States, which divided the dollar into 100 cents in the late 18th century."]},
{"question":"As a Sole Proprietor, will \u201cemployer\u201d Solo 401k contributions count towards gross income?","human_answers":["This seems to depend on what kind of corporation you have set up. If you're set up as a sole proprietor, then the Solo 401k contributions, whether employee or employer, will be deducted from your gross income.  Thus they don't reduce it. If you're set up as an S-Corp, then the employer contributions, similar to large employer contributions, will be deducted from wages, and won't show up in Box 1 on your W-2, so they would reduce your gross income.  (Note, employee contributions also would go away from Box 1, but would still be in Box 3 and 5 for FICA\/payroll tax purposes). This is nicely discussed in detail here. The IRS page that discusses this in more (harder to understand) detail is here. Separately, I think a discussion of \"Gross Income\" is merited, as it has a special definition for sole proprietorships. The IRS defines it in publication 501 as: Gross income.    Gross income is all income you receive in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt from tax. If you are married and live with your spouse in a community property state, half of any income defined by state law as community income may be considered yours. For a list of community property states, see Community property states under Married Filing Separately, later. Self-employed persons.    If you are self-employed in a business that provides services (where products are not a factor), your gross income from that business is the gross receipts. If you are self-employed in a business involving manufacturing, merchandising, or mining, your gross income from that business is the total sales minus the cost of goods sold. In either case, you must add any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources. So I think that regardless of 401(k) contributions, your gross income is your gross receipts (if you're a contractor, it's probably the total listed on your 1099(s))."],"chatgpt_answers":["\u8fd8\u6709\u5c31\u662f\u529e\u5361\u7684\u624b\u673a\u53f7\u7801\u6ca1\u7528\u4e86\u53ef\u6302\u5931\u4e0d\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u7684\u624b\u673a\u53f7\u7801\u6ca1\u6709\u7528\u4e86\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u6302\u5931\u60a8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5361\u3002\u6302\u5931\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u9632\u6b62\u60a8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5361\u88ab\u76d7\u7528\u6216\u88ab\u4ed6\u4eba\u975e\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u6302\u5931\u60a8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5361\uff1a\u5728\u7ebf\u6302\u5931\uff1a\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u767b\u5f55\u60a8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5361\u5728\u7ebf\u8d26\u6237\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u6302\u5931\u529f\u80fd\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u673a\u94f6\u884c\u6302\u5931\uff1a\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u60a8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5361\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u624b\u673a\u94f6\u884c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u6302\u5931\u529f\u80fd\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u8bdd\u6302\u5931\uff1a\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u62e8\u6253\u60a8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5361\u7684\u5ba2\u670d\u7535\u8bdd\uff0c\u5e76\u544a\u8bc9\u5ba2\u670d\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u6302\u5931\u60a8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5361\u3002\u5230\u94f6\u884c\u67dc\u53f0\u6302\u5931\uff1a\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5230\u60a8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u67dc\u53f0\uff0c\u51fa\u793a\u60a8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc1\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u544a\u8bc9\u94f6\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u6302\u5931\u60a8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5361\u3002\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u5728\u94f6\u884c\u5361\u6302\u5931\u4e4b\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u5df1\u624b\u673a\u53f7\u7801\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8054\u7cfb\u94f6\u884c\u53d6\u6d88\u6302\u5931\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5361\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u76d7\u7528\u6216\u88ab\u4ed6\u4eba\u975e\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u7acb\u5373\u8054\u7cfb\u94f6\u884c\u5e76\u5411\u5176\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u94f6\u884c\u4f1a\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u53d6\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u63aa\u65bd\u4fdd\u62a4\u60a8\u7684"]},

{"question":"Why does my checking\/savings account offer a higher interest rate than a standalone savings account?","human_answers":["The key is that you need to use your debit card to earn the higher interest rate. The bank can offer a higher interest rate on accounts connected with a debit card because: They earn additional income through debit card fees charged towards account holders, among other things. They offer the higher interest rate specifically to encourage people to use their debit cards. By offering a joint checking\/savings account that requires you to use your debit card, the bank is assuming that you'll keep more money in your account than you would in a standard checking-only account. Your higher balance translates into more money the bank can loan out or invest, which usually leads to higher profit for them. Businesses pay fees to the bank to accept debit cards. These fees represent another source of profit for the bank. The more you use your debit card, the more the bank earns in fees, so the bank encourages you to use your debit card more frequently through incentives like a higher interest rate or waiving fees on your account if you use your card enough. Plus, since it's likely that an individual who maintains a fairly high balance in an account linked to a debit card is going to spend more (simply because they can spend more), banks will sometimes waive fees on the consumer side for balances over a certain amount."],"chatgpt_answers":["There could be a number of reasons why a checking or savings account at a bank or credit union might offer a higher interest rate than a standalone savings account. Here are a few potential explanations:Relationship discounts: Many financial institutions offer higher interest rates to customers who have both a checking and a savings account with them. This is because having multiple accounts with the same institution can be more convenient for the customer and may also be more profitable for the bank or credit union.Account balances: Some checking and savings accounts may offer higher interest rates for customers who maintain higher balances in their accounts. For example, a bank may offer a higher interest rate on a checking account for customers who keep at least $1,000 in their account.Account usage: Some checking and savings accounts may offer higher interest rates for customers who use their accounts frequently. For example, a bank may offer a higher interest rate on a checking account for customers who make a certain number of transactions per month.Special promotions: Financial institutions may also offer higher interest rates on checking and savings accounts as part of a special promotion or to attract new customers. These promotions may be temporary, so it's important to check with the institution to see if the higher interest rate is still being offered.It's always a good idea to shop around and compare the interest rates and other terms and conditions of different financial products before making a decision.

If you do not have insurance and your home is damaged, you will have to pay for the repairs or replacements out of pocket, which can be financially devastating if you are not prepared for it.Similarly, if you have an automobile and have auto insurance, you are protected against damages or injuries resulting from an accident.

{"question":"How exactly does dealing in stock make me money?","human_answers":["Generally, a share of stock entitles the owner to all future per-share dividends paid by the company, plus a fraction of the company's assets net value in the event of liquidation.  If one knew in advance the time and value of all such payouts, the value of the stock should equal the present cash value of that payout stream, which would in turn be the sum of the cash values of all the individual payouts. As time goes by, the present cash value of each upcoming payout will increase until such time as it is actually paid, whereupon it will cease to contribute to the stock's value. Because people are not clairvoyant, they generally don't know exactly what future payouts a stock is going to make.  A sane price for a stock, however, may be assigned by estimating the present cash value of its future payments.  If unfolding events would cause a reasonable person to revise estimates of future payments upward, the price of the stock should increase.  If events cause estimates to be revised downward, the price should fall. In a sane marketplace, if the price of a stock is below people's estimates of its payouts' current cash value, people should buy the stock and push the price upward.  If it is above people's estimates, they should sell the stock and push the price downward.  Note that in a sane marketplace, rising prices are a red-flag indicator for people to stop buying.  Unfortunately, sometimes bulls see a red flag as a signal to charge ahead.  When that happens, prices may soar through the roof, but it's important to note that the value of the stock will still be the present cash value of its future payouts.  If that value is $10\/share, someone who buys a share for $50 basically gives the seller $40 that he was not entitled to, and which the buyer will never get back.  The buyer might manage to convince someone else to pay him $60 for the share, but that simply means the new buyer is giving the the previous one $50 that he wasn't entitled to either.  If the price falls back to $10, calling that fall a \"market correction\" wouldn't be a euphemism, but rather state a fact: the share was worth $10 before people sold it for crazy prices, and still worth $10 afterward.  It was the market price that was in error. The important thing to focus on as a sane investor is what the stock is actually going to pay out in relation to what you put in.  It's not necessary to look only at present price\/earnings ratios, since some stocks may pay little or nothing today but pay handsomely next year.  What's important, however, is that there be a reasonable likelihood that in the foreseeable future the stock will pay dividends sufficient to justify its cost."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several ways to make money through stocks:Dividends: Some companies pay out a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. If you own shares in a company that pays dividends, you will receive a portion of those profits.Capital gains: If you buy a stock at a lower price and sell it later at a higher price, you will earn a profit, known as a capital gain.Stock splits: A stock split is when a company increases the number of shares outstanding by issuing more shares to existing shareholders. This can result in a lower share price, but you will end up with more shares, which could potentially lead to higher dividends or capital gains in the future.It's important to note that investing in stocks carries some level of risk, as the value of your investments can fluctuate due to market conditions and other factors.

{"question":"How to find historical stock price for a de-listed or defunct company?","human_answers":["Such data is typically only available from paid sources due to the amount of research involved in determining the identity of delisted securities, surviving entities in merger scenarios, company name changes, symbol changes, listing venue changes, research of all capital events such as splits, and to ensure that the data coverage is complete. Many stocks that are delisted from a major exchange due to financial difficulties are still publicly tradeable companies with their continuing to trade as \"OTC\" shares.  Some large companies even have periods where they traded for a period of their history as OTC.  This happened to NYSE:NAV (Navistar) from Feb 2007 to July 2008, where they were delisted due to accounting statement inaccuracies and auditor difficulties.   In the case of Macromedia, it was listed on NASDAQ 13 Dec 1993 and had its final day of trading on 2 Dec 2005.  It had one stock split (2:1) with ex-date of 16 Oct 1995 and no dividends were ever paid. Other companies are harder to find.  For example, the bankrupt General Motors (was NYSE:GM) became Motoros Liquidation Corp (OTC:MTLQQ) and traded that way for almost 21 months before finally delisting.

{"question":"Shouldn't a Roth IRA accumulate more than 1 cent of interest per month?","human_answers":["Terminology aside.  Your gains for this year in a mutual fund do seem low.  These are things that can be quickly, and precisely answered through a conversation with your broker. You can request info on the performance of the fund you are invested in from the broker.  They are required to disclose this information to you.   They can give you the performance of the fund overall, as well as break down for you the specific stocks and bonds that make up the fund, and how they are performing. Talk about what kind of fund it is.  If your projected retirement date is far in the future your fund should probably be on the aggressive side.  Ask what the historic average is for the fund you're in.  Ask about more aggressive funds, or less if you prefer a lower average but more stable performance.  Your broker should be able to adequately, and in most cases accurately, set your expectation. Also ask about fees.  Good brokerages charge reasonable fees, that are typically based on the gains the fund makes, not your total investment.  Make sure you understand what you are paying. Even without knowing the management fees, your growth this year should be of concern.  It is exceptionally low, in a year that showed good gains in many market sectors.  Speak with your broker and decide if you will stick with this fund or have your IRA invest in a different fund. Finally JW8 makes a great point, in that your fund may perform well or poorly over any given short term, but long term your average should fall within the expected range for the type of fund you're invested in (though, not guaranteed).

{"question":"~$75k in savings - Pay off house before new home?","human_answers":["With an annual income of $120,000 you can be approved for a $2800 monthly payment on your mortgage. The trickier problem is that you will save quite a bit on that mortgage payment if you can avoid PMI, which means that you should be targeting a 20% down-payment on your next purchase. With a $500,000 budget for a new home, that means you should put $100,000 down. You only have $75,000 saved, so you can either wait until you save another $25,000, or you can refinance your current property for $95k+ $25k = $120k which would give you about a $575 monthly payment (at 30 years at 4%) on your current property. Your new property should be a little over $1,900 per month if you finance $400,000 of it. Those figures do not include property tax or home owners insurance escrow payments. Are you prepared to have about $2,500 in mortgage payments should your renters stop paying or you can't find renters?  Those numbers also do not include an emergency fund.

If I were you, I would not count on rental money when running the numbers to be sure it will work. I would probably also wait until I had saved $100,000 outright for the down-payment on the new place instead of refinancing the current place, but that's just a reflection of my more conservative approach to finances.

{"question":"What is the economic explanation for the high cost of weddings?","human_answers":["There is the price they want and the price you pay. Everything is negotiable when its a service (always possible, but usually harder with actual \"goods\"). You should always haggle and price match your vendors. You can also try going to different vendors and not telling them its for a wedding and see if there really is a price difference. For example, call up a florist and say you need X, Y, and Z for a corporate banquet or for a special event for which you cannot give the details. If you then tell them its actually a wedding, and they blindly raise it without a good justification, move on. That said, they jack up the price because they know most people will says \"it's my wedding\", \"it's once in a lifetime\", \"it's MY special day\", etc.... The same is true about diamonds, their price does not reflect the actual supply and demand ratio, just the perception that has been created. However, as mentioned in some of the comments above, the service provided at a wedding may be different or more involved than just a normal dinner The more important issue is ensuring there are no back fees, no hidden fees, and you have well written, well reviewed contracts. For example, we know a couple whose caterer added a mandatory 20% gratuity, regardless of the service which was provided. Most venues or restaurants will not be making the bar a lose-leader, but they will charge for other things.  You can also save money by buying used or looking on ebay for prices closer to wholesale for the product. I think a good analogy to this is the Recent Time Magazine article on the price of healthcare - it costs a lot because its a small market and its harder to navigate, and most are not experienced shoppers in the area or don't have control over the individual item costs."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several economic factors that can contribute to the high cost of weddings. One factor is the law of supply and demand. When demand for a product or service is high, the price tends to be higher. This can be the case with weddings, as many people want to have a lavish and memorable event, and may be willing to pay more for it.Another factor is the cost of goods and services needed for a wedding. These can include the cost of the venue, catering, decorations, flowers, entertainment, and attire. Many of these costs can be quite high, especially if the wedding is being held at a high-end location or if the couple is seeking top-quality vendors.Additionally, the cost of a wedding can be influenced by cultural and social norms. In some cultures and societies, it is expected that the wedding will be a grand and elaborate affair, with a large guest list and numerous elements of celebration. This can drive up the cost of the event.Finally, the cost of a wedding can also be influenced by personal preferences and individual choices. Some couples may choose to have a more expensive wedding in order to have the exact wedding of their dreams, while others may be more budget-conscious and try to keep costs down."]},

{"question":"Do I need to start a 529 plan for each child (2 separate plans), or can I just open one 529 plan and let both children use it?","human_answers":["MrChrister makes some good points, but I saw his invitation to offer a counter opinion. First, there is a normal annual deposit limit of $13,000 per parent or donee. This is the gift limit, due to rise to $14,000 in 2013.  If your goal is strictly to fund college, and this limit isn't an issue for you, the one account may be fine unless both kids are in school at the same time. In that case, you're going to need to change beneficiaries every year to assign withdrawals properly.  But, as you mention, there's gift money that your considering depositing to the account. In this case, there's really a legal issue. The normal 529 allows changes in beneficiary, and gifts to your child need to be held for that child in an irrevocable arrangement such as a UTMA account. There is a 529 flavor that provides for no change of beneficiary, a UTMA 529. Clearly, in that case, you need separate accounts.  In conclusion, I think the single account creates more issues than it potentially solves. If the true gift money from others is minimal, maybe you should just keep it in a regular account. Edit - on further reflection, I strongly suggest you keep the relatives' gifts in a separate account, and when the kids are old enough to have legitimate earned income, use this money to open and deposit to Roth IRAs. They can deposit the lesser of their earned income or $5000 in 2012, $5500 in 2013.  This serves two goals - avoiding the risk of gift money being 'stolen' from one child for benefit of the other, and putting it into an account that can help your children long term, but not impact college aid as would a simple savings or brokerage account."],"chatgpt_answers":["You can open a single 529 plan and let both children use it. A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan that is specifically designed to help people save for higher education expenses. The account owner (also known as the account beneficiary) can be any individual, and the account can be used to pay for the qualified higher education expenses of the account beneficiary or any other beneficiary designated by the account owner.This means that you can open a single 529 plan and designate both of your children as beneficiaries. Then, when they are ready to go to college, you can use the funds in the 529 plan to pay for their education expenses. You can also change the beneficiary of the account at any time, so if one child decides not to go to college or has already completed their education, you can change the beneficiary to the other child.Keep in mind that some states offer tax benefits for contributions to a 529 plan, and these benefits may vary depending on the state in which you reside. It's a good idea to research the specific tax benefits offered by your state and consider how they may impact your decision to open a 529 plan.

For example, if you become a Registered Market Maker on, say, the BATS stock exchange, you'll get some amazing rebates and reduced transaction prices; however, in order to qualify for Registered Market Maker status you have to maintain constant orders in the book for hundreds of equities at significant volumes.  An individual retail trader is certainly permitted to do that, but it's probably too expensive. Algorithmic trading is not the same as automated trading (algorithmic trading can be non-automated, and automated trading can be non-algorithmic), and both can be anywhere from low- to high-frequency.

Unless your algorithms are smarter than every other algorithm in the industry, an individual retail trader operating through a broker's trading platform cannot react quickly enough to succeed at either of those.

This seems to be the magic number that keeps most of the nightmare tenants out makes sure they have a job nearby that pays at least three times their annual rent every renewal, adjust your tenant's rent to be approximately 5% less than going rates in your area.  Use Zillow as a guide.  Keeping just below market rates keeps tenants from moving to cheaper options. do not rent to anyone under 30 and single.  Trust me trust me trust me.  you can't legally do this officially, but do it while offering another acceptable reason for rejection; there's always something you could say that's legitimate (bad credit, or chose another tenant, etc.) charge a 5% late fee starting 10 days after the rent is due.  20 days late, file for eviction to let the tenant know you mean business. Don't sink yourself too much in debt, put enough money down so that you start profitable.  I made the mistake of burying myself and I haven't barely been able to breathe for the entire 14 years.  It's just now finally coming into profitability. Don't get adjustable rate or balloon loans under any circumstances.  Fixed 30 only.  You can pay it down in 20 years and get the same benefits as if you got a fixed 20, but you will want the option of paying less some months so get the 30 and treat it like a 20. don't even try to find your own tenants.  Use a realtor and take the 10% cost hit.  They actually save you money because they can show your place to a lot more prospective tenants and it will be rented much sooner.  Empty place = empty wallet.  Also, block out the part of the realtor's agreement-to-lease where it states they keep getting the 10% every year thereafter.  Most realtors will go along with this just to get the first year, but if they don't, find another realtor. buy all in the same community if you can, then you can use the same vendor list, the same lease agreement, the same realtor, the same documentation, spreadsheets, etc.  Much much easier to have everything a clone.  They say don't put all your eggs in one basket, but the reality is, running a bunch of properties is a lot of work, and the more similar they are, the more you can duplicate your work for free.  That's worth a lot more day-to-day than the remote chance your entire community goes up in flames"],"chatgpt_answers":["Becoming a landlord can be a good investment for several reasons. Some people invest in rental properties because they can generate a steady stream of passive income. If you own a rental property, you can collect rent from tenants, which can provide a regular source of income without requiring much effort on your part.In addition, rental properties can appreciate in value over time. As the value of the property increases, so does the value of your investment. This can provide a potential source of capital gains if you decide to sell the property in the future.Finally, owning rental properties can also provide tax benefits. For example, you may be able to claim deductions for certain expenses related to the property, such as mortgage interest, property taxes, and maintenance and repair costs.It's important to keep in mind that being a landlord also involves responsibilities and risks. You will need to maintain the property, screen and select tenants, and handle any legal issues that may arise. You may also face vacancy periods when you don't have tenants, which could impact your income. Additionally, the value of your property could decline, potentially leading to financial losses. As with any investment, it's important to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before making a decision."]},
{"question":"Why pay for end-of-day historical prices?","human_answers":["There are several reasons to pay for data instead of using Yahoo Finance, although these reasons don't necessarily apply to you if you're only planning to use the data for personal use.  Yahoo will throttle you if you attempt to download too much data in a short time period. You can opt to use the Yahoo Query Language (YQL), which does provide another interface to their financial data apart from simply downloading the CSV files. Although the rate limit is higher for YQL, you may still run into it. An API that a paid data provider exposes will likely have higher thresholds.  Although the reliability varies throughout the site, Yahoo Finance isn't considered the most reliable of sources. You can't beat free, of course, but at least for research purposes, the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at UChicago and Wharton is considered the gold standard. On the commercial side, data providers like eSignal, Bloomberg, Reuters also enjoy widespread popularity. Although both the output from YQL and Yahoo's current CSV output are fairly standard, they won't necessarily remain that way. A commercial API is basically a contract with the data provider that they won't change the format without significant prior notice, but it's reasonable to assume that if Yahoo wanted to, they could make minor changes to the format and break many commercial applications. A change in Yahoo's format would likely break many sites or applications too, but their terms of use do state that Yahoo \"may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Yahoo! Finance Modules at any time, including the availability of any Yahoo! Finance Modules. Yahoo! may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Yahoo! Finance Modules or the Yahoo! Web site without notice or liability.\" If you're designing a commercial application, a paid provider will probably provide technical support for their API.  According to Yahoo Finance's license terms, you can't use the data in a commercial application unless you specifically use their \"badges\" (whatever those are). See here. In this post, a Yahoo employee states: The Finance TOS is fairly specific. Redistribution of data is only   allowed if you are using the badges the team has created. Otherwise, you can use YQL or whatever method to obtain data for   personal use. The license itself states that you may not: sell, lease, or sublicense the Yahoo! Finance Modules or access   thereto or derive income from the use or provision of the Yahoo!   Finance Modules, whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or   otherwise, without Yahoo!'s prior, express, written permission In short, for personal use, Yahoo Finance is more than adequate. For research or commercial purposes, a data provider is a better option. Furthermore, many commercial applications require more data than Yahoo provides, e.g. tick-by-tick data for equities, derivatives, futures, data on mergers, etc., which a paid data source will likely provide. Yahoo is also known for inaccuracies in its financial statements; I can't find any examples at the moment, but I had a professor who enjoyed pointing out flaws in the 10K's that he had come across. I've always assumed this is because the data were manually entered, although I would assume EDGAR has some method for automatic retrieval. If you want data that are guaranteed to be accurate, or at least have a support contract associated with them so you know who to bother if it isn't, you'll need to pay for it."],"chatgpt_answers":["End-of-day (EOD) historical prices refer to the closing prices of a security at the end of a particular trading day.

{"question":"I might use a credit card convenience check. What should I consider?","human_answers":["Well, you might take a minor hit to your credit score. This is snapshot of my credit utilization written for an article on my site. The point there was that zero card use actually dinged the score, but for you, going over the 20% level is the risk. It's not too large a hit, depending how high the utilization goes. I'd not lose sleep over it. Kind of you to help."],"chatgpt_answers":["Using a credit card convenience check can be a useful way to pay for things or access credit if you need it, but it's important to be aware of the potential risks and costs associated with this type of transaction. Here are a few things to consider:Interest and fees: Credit card convenience checks often come with higher interest rates and fees than regular credit card purchases. Be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully and understand the costs associated with using a convenience check.Credit utilization: Using a convenience check can increase your credit utilization ratio, which is the amount of credit you are using compared to the total amount of credit available to you. This can negatively impact your credit score.Fraud risk: Convenience checks can be stolen and used by someone else, so it's important to keep them in a safe place and not leave them lying around.Alternatives: Consider whether there are other options available to you, such as transferring money from a savings account or taking out a personal loan, that might be more cost-effective.Overall, it's important to carefully weigh the pros and cons of using a credit card convenience check and to be mindful of the potential risks and costs involved."]}
